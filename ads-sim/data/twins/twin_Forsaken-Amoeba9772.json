      "selftext": "Over the past few years I have dealt with a stitch in my right side when I run with intensity. Recently I found that it is caused by my right glute not activating properly and  l have been doing activation work before every long, steady star or tempo run.  I will do donkey kicks, banded abductions, bridges, etc.  this seems to cause the stitch to not show up in training, but on race days on flat courses I still find that I can feel the stitch there and I need to focus on maintaining good form in order to keep it from impeding my race.\n\nThus, has anyone found that they had the same issue and was able to fix it permanently?",
