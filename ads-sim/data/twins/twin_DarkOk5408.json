      "selftext": "Has anyone used Runna for both programming in runs and weight training?\n\nCurrently using a local PT who has been great, but I've been switched over to someone else in the 'group', and it's just not working out. I can't go back to the old PT for the time being as their books are closed for personal reasons, and it's likely to be the case for upto 6 months.\n\nSo ideally I'm looking for something to programme runs, with the aim of getting faster, but also incorporating the gym.\n\nAnything I see seems to be 5 runs with the optional weight session and I can only commit to 2 runs and 2 gym sessions per week.",
