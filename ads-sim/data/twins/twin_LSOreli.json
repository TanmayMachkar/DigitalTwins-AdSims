      "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nI moved to Colorado Springs from South Korea in August of last year, the altitude went from sea level to 6500-7000 minimum. Long story short, running is hellish now.  \n\nI was told I would acclimate within a few weeks, six months at absolute maximum, but it is just horrible all of the time still eight months in. Even abysmally slow running feels like I'm being choked and can never catch my breath, I never hit my stride, or get the familiar runners high. My base run pace has dropped in excess of 4 minutes a mile each. Leaving Korea I could easily hold an 8 minute pace basically indefinitely and now just keeping myself moving, at ANY pace, for 30 minutes is an incredible mental battle. \n\nI don't know how I'm supposed to train, I've kept myself somewhat together by doing HIIT since I can mentally get through very short bursts of high activity. But man, I can't imagine doing even a 10K here despite runs of that length being something I am very used to doing multiple times a week during normal training. \n\nI get my performance should be less (especially since I can barely train anymore), but I feel worse now than I did when I was very obese and just getting into running for the first time.  \n\nI stay extra hydrated here (its also very dry) and take my multivitamin.  \n  \nAny advice?
