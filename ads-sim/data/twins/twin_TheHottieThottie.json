      "selftext": "I\u2019ve found that one of my biggest mental challenges when it comes to running is comparing myself to other runners. It is mostly in the form of \u201cthat person is so much better at running than me, so that means I am not good enough\u201d or feeling embarrassed to share that I run because my pace/distances may not be as fast/long as others\u2019.\n\nPersonally, I am not super affected by the running influencers, it\u2019s more when I\u2019m meeting someone new who also runs or when I pass other runners in my neighborhood.\n\nHow have you escaped this trap of comparing yourself in the sport?",
