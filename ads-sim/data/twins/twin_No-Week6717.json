      "title": "Race Report: 10K PR After 1.5 Months of Focused Running (7min Drop from Previous Best)",
      "selftext": "# Race Info\n\n* **Distance:** 10km (solo time trial)\n* **Date:** 02.08.2025\n* **Finish Time:** 55:00\n* **Previous 10K PR (1 month ago):** 1:02:02\n* **Pace:** 5:30/km\n* **Previous Pace:** 6:12/km\n* **Goal:** Sub-57 \u2013 \u2705\n\n# Background\n\nI\u2019m a 32-year-old male, currently weighing 70kg, down from 75kg when I started training about 1.5 months ago. Until then, I used to run casually \u2014 maybe 7km per month, never more than 20km per week.\n\nWhat changed? I committed to daily running, dialed in recovery and nutrition, and got myself a proper GPS watch to track VO2 Max and effort more accurately. **I\u2019ve gone from a VO2 Max of 43.5 (lab) to 53 (watch)**, and built up to 85km per week of running.\n\nSo far, **I\u2019ve logged 330km in total during** this new chapter.\n\nMy Zone 3 pace is 5:30/km at 153 bpm, and I ran both my recent 10k and the previous one at that exact HR \u2014 so the pace improvement has come from efficiency gains and consistent training.\n\n# Plan\n\nI\u2019m currently following a Garmin Coach plan with a goal to run a 10k at 4:40/km pace by October 1st. So far, the focus has been on consistency, aerobic base, and staying injury-free.\n\n# Training Choices\n\n* Running almost every day (mostly Zone 2, +1-hour runs)\n* VO2 max and sprint intervals a couple times a week\n* Cross-training with bouldering and calisthenics\n* Core strength training\n* Volume at \\~85km per week with minimal burnout\n\n# Pre-Race\n\n* Ate a banana \\~30 minutes before starting\n* Wore my Asics Novablast 5 (first race in them)\n* Carried a trail vest with electrolyte drink (sipped every 15 mins)\n* Took carb gummies every 15 mins \u2014 trying out fueling strategy for longer efforts\n\n# Race Breakdown\n\n* KM 1: 4:20 \u2013 went out too hot\n* KM 2: 5:13 \u2013 reeled it back\n* KM 3: 5:20 \u2013 started locking into rhythm\n* KM 4\u201310: steady between 5:35\u20135:45/km, doing loops around a 1km park\u2013 relaxed form, focused breathing, consistent cadence\n\n# Mindset\n\nI feel like I'm entering a completely new zone. Running gives me this insane feeling of peace \u2014 like I\u2019m in a Zen temple retreat, totally in the moment. No distractions, just me and the movement. That feeling has become just as important as the metrics.\n\n# What\u2019s Next\n\n* Keep building toward my 4:40/km 10K in October\n* Incorporate more strides, hill sprints, and strength work\n* Stick to the joy: running + bouldering + calisthenics\n* Run my first ultramarathon before the end of the year\n\nAlso worth noting: **My race prediction from the watch has gone from 4:08:46 to 3:31:28 for the marathon.** I haven\u2019t actually run a full yet, so I take it with a grain of salt \u2014 but it keeps me motivated and dreaming big.\n\n# Would love to hear from you\n\n* Is this progress promising for someone aiming to move into ultras, and in general, a beginner?\n* Have you made the jump from max running half-marathons into ultras? If so, how has this journey been like?\n* How much trust do you place in Garmin\u2019s race predictions? \n\nThanks for reading \u2014 I\u2019m just getting started and really open to sharing progress stories. Let\u2019s gooo !!!",
