      "selftext": "Exactly as the title states. I have a bubble butt - thick thigh combo, and every time I try something other than a biker short or a short with a very long inseam, it fails me. It\u2019s a little harder because my waist is slimmer than my lower body, so it either fits one or the other. I often see women running with the cute V-cut shorts that are a little flowy I am wondering if I\u2019m missing out! I\u2019m kind of sick of the daily runner biker short only look, they\u2019re definitely functional and they prevent chafing (until they\u2019re worn through) but maybe I haven\u2019t found what will be my new bff for the cute but functional chafe game! I do have bodyglide and I lay it on thick but sometimes it just doesnt cut it and the shorts I do have ride up (which is rather unflattering and uncomfortable digging the fabric out every 2 minutes). Maybe I\u2019m looking for something that doesn\u2019t exist. Maybe you wonderful people will lead me to the promised land product. I figured if anyone would know, it\u2019s yall! Bonus points for high waist, maybe with a drawstring to actually fit the waist, and pockets. Thank you in advance!! \n\nP.S. if there\u2019s any general tips on sizing/fabric/ styles please share! Would love to know what has worked for you in the past\ud83d\udc96",
