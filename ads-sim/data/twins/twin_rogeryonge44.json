That seemed perfect. I was scrolling through a list of races 7-9 weeks in the future, trying to lift my sprits after cancelling everything for Boston 2025. \n\nIn 2022 the Manitoba Marathon was my first attempt at the distance. I went into it with big goals \u2013 sub 3 and BQ \u2013 my pair of trusty Nike Pegasus and no idea what I was doing. As it turns out my lack of preparation somehow wasn\u2019t what doomed me, as the race was stopped after about 90 minutes due to extreme heat. I would go on to finish the course, but the timing equipment had been turned off and I received no official time and was listed as a DNF. That felt harsh.\n \nThree years later with maybe slightly more of a clue about running and even bigger goals it seemed like good symmetry. Or at least a good story. \n\n### Training\nI registered 9 weeks before the race. Boston was scuttled because a significant issue with my IT band and quad. Disappointing as it was to miss that race, I wasn\u2019t willing to the risk of not addressing it early and, with the injury hitting right at the start of my taper, I thought I had the opportunity to salvage my fitness. Recovery, with support from a physio, left me 6 weeks to execute a mini build and taper for Winnipeg.\n\nMy plan was focused on sharpening my existing fitness and staying healthy enough to give a good effort on race day. I wanted to hit some key workouts to gauge my progress along the way both in terms of fitness and how my body was holding up: \nWeek 1: 20 miler with 15mi easy and 5 at MP\nWeek 2: Half-Marathon race a little faster than MP\nWeek 3: 20 mile LR workout feature 6x1mi repeats at threshold\nWeek 4: Half-Marathon race at HMP\n\nThe two half-marathon races were already on my calendar, so I\u2019m not sure if they were ideal but they were fun races that I didn\u2019t want to miss out on. I had physio session at the end of each week to make sure I was still on track and otherwise just ran based on how I felt. After the end of week 4 I went into my taper, with only a little more tempo work before the race. My last proper workout was 10 days out.\n\n### Pre-Race\nI flew out to Winnipeg on the Friday, two days before the race, with my Wife and Mother In-law who came out to visit some family and visit around Winnipeg for the weekend. In the past I\u2019ve maybe been guilty of overdoing it in the days before a race, so I mostly spent the warm afternoons inside and off my feet. Friday and Saturday I ran an easy 5kms with a few strides on Saturday and got a few walks in, but otherwise rested. \n\nSunday \u2013 race day \u2013 I woke up shortly after 4am to for some coffee and breakfast. I\u2019m apparently slow to digest so even with just a piece of toast, jam and banana the early start was normal and necessary. I sipped on some Maurten caf 320 on the drive down to the start. \n\nI arrived with about 1:20 minutes before the start. To help manage my ITBS I had a lengthy warmup and stretching routine to go through. Somehow that took even longer than expected, and by the time I had my race shoes tied up and gels tucked away I could hear \u2018O Canada\u2019 being performed at the starting line. \n\nNormally I\u2019m pathologically early to the point of comedy, so feeling late was uncomfortable. I jogged up to the start corral with few minutes to spare to realize that I had no idea how to get in. In the distance I could vaguely see a point where people were entering but it was far back and I\u2019m not one to try and push my back up to my assigned corral. A runner in front of me was in the same predicament and recruited some help to hop the barrier. I grit my teeth and followed him over \u2013 without help \u2013 clambering over the short steel fence without much dignity and landing way to hard on my Endorphin Elite 2s, \u201cbottoming out\u201d the soft foam. Shoes not necessarily made for jumping \u2013 noted. \n\n### Race\nThe race went off and after reassuring myself that I hadn\u2019t wrecked my shoes I was eager to settle into an early rhythm, aiming for even splits on the flat course. About 150 meters in I heard something clatter to the ground nearby, turned and realized one of my Caf 100s had fallen from my pocket. Not ideal for my nutrition plan but also painfully expensive, especially since the Caf 100s aren\u2019t available in Canada. I buried my second one further in the pocket, an action I\u2019d forget 25km later when I reached for it, couldn\u2019t find it, and assumed I lost that one too. \n\nEarly on I tucked in with a pack of five including a local runner - the greetings and cheers he exchanged with spectators gave me away - a youngster clearly running well slower than his fitness, two running much faster than their fitness, and myself. \nSomewhere around the 5km mark we were set to make a turn onto one of the large boulevards with a traffic lane coned off for runners. Only this lane hadn\u2019t be closed yet. A police officer directed us onto the sidewalk, calling unhelpfully from behind, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, they are closing it now.\u201d  \n\nI could only laugh at the symmetry between this and the 2022 race when we had also initially been directed onto the sidewalk after the race was cancelled. After about 1km we rejoined a now closed road.\n\nA large deer crossed our path as we entered Assiniboine Park, and we briefly became a pack of 7 when we picked up a runner who\u2019d fallen off the lead pack and a spectator started running beside us while clapping and (hopefully) cheering in a language I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nOn the other end of the park, I dropped back a little when the young fast runner sped up and the others attempted to follow. The runner who had dropped from the lead pack fell back next, followed by another who had be labouring for some time. We passed 25km and I started to feel tightness in my right quad. That was supposed to be my good side, but it didn\u2019t seem too serious yet. I was sure I could make it to 32km and then I\u2019d see what I had left. \n\nThe young fast runner was long gone and so was the pack of five. The local was still about 20 meters ahead but the others were out of site behind before 30km. At 32km the local fell back to me. I checked my time and decided, since quad hadn\u2019t gotten any worse, to make a short push. During my last marathon (Marine Corps 2025) I\u2019d gone through 32km feeling very strong but faded badly over the last 5. I was resolved to hold my pace as best I could this time. \n\nI can\u2019t remember exactly when it started but a patchwork of runners from other distances began populating the course. A 5k, 10k and Half-Marathon were being run at the same time, and now that I was nearing the finish I\u2019d be running through the slower parts of those races. In the cancelled 2022 race the only other runners I remember over the last few kilometers were faster marathoners who\u2019d burned themselves out in the heat and were now walking in. This time around I weaved, dipped and ducked through the thicker crowds and narrowing course. I became more frustrated in my desperation to maintain what momentum I could and worried about also running an 8-year-old down from behind. At 40km I ran into a woman who abruptly stepped in front of me to give a spectator a high-five.\n\nThe race finishes at the University/CFL stadium. Having picked my way through the crowd I made a right hand turn into the finishing chute that led into the stadium and onto the field. Instinctively I followed the runners ahead onto the left-hand side of the coned-off chute, wondering the whole time who thought it was a good idea to make me run through this mass of humanity.\n\n I stepped across the line, veered towards a volunteer who handed me a medal, doubled over and stopped my watch. The clock when I finished read 2:39 and change, but that I was for the half-marathon. Did it start 5 minutes later? I checked my watch. 2:44:45. Under the goal.\n\n### Post-race\nAll my previous marathons have had distinct moments that live clear as day in my memory. At L.A it\u2019s watching the mass of runners charge down the street from the top of Vin Scully Ave, at Erie 2 it\u2019s the Banana Man who I had to pull back onto the timing mat, and  at Boston 2024 it\u2019s dying on the crest of heartbreak and the kind woman who told me not to give up when she saw me about to stop and walk. What I hope to remember from this race is the image of my wife cutting through the crowd to get to me.\n\n \u201cYou did it!\u201d, she said, her eyes shining with sympathetic joy. \n\nI asked if she knew my chip tip. 2:44:25. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s under your goal,\u201d she reminded me, \u201cand I bet you would have been faster if you\u2019d gone down the marathon finish on the right-hand side, dummy.\u201d \n\nA fitting mistake and another opportunity to be grateful. This was a good day.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n",
