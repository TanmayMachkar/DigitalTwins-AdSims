      "selftext": "I heard a lot of good things about calf compression sleeves and i regularly get some lower leg pain while running so i got some. \nOther people said it was a noticible difference and it helped a lot but ive ran with them today and the day before yesterday and i feel like not only did they not help but they made it worse\n\nHas anyone else had this happen with calf sleeves? Is the reduction of pain whilst running not really true for them?",
