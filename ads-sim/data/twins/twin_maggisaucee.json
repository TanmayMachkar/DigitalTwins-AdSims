      "selftext": "Question for runners of all levels: how do you motivate yourself to go on a run when the weather is extremely hot or humid? Summers get pretty intense where I live and I sweat easily. Plus the extreme weather tires me out quickly and my feet feel too hot in my shoes (ASICS GT2000s). Any tips on how to maintain a regular running regimen when the weather outside is saying \"don't go\"? I know I can do indoor running on treadmills but I prefer outside.\n\nSide note, but tips for running in winter would also be appreciated.",
