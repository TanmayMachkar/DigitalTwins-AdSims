      "selftext": "Hello ! I've been running 4 times a week for the past six weeks coming back from a 6 months break (not due to injury). I've started slow (15-25 minutes runs) and 90% zone 1-2 and I'm now at four 45-55 minutes runs a week. Following a 80/20 intensity repartition. \n\nI decided to implement some cross training in my week that would be either cycling, elliptical, stair climbing or uphill walking to do more physical activity without running more and risking injury. At first I was thinking 4 runs and 1 cross training session or 3 runs and 2 cross training sessions.\n\nBut after doing an easy 40 minutes cycling session (easy being my cycling Zone 1 and 2), I feel like I'd like to do maybe 3-4 cross training sessions per week. Would it be okay ? Or would it lead to injury ?\nIf I'm able to do 3 or 4 sessions, should all of them be easy sessions or can I push a bit on one or two without increasing the risk of injury?\n\nThank you in advance and have a great day !\n\nPS : I'm doing the 75Hard program that asks two 45' workouts per day. For the past 30 days I've mainly been running and walking with 3 strength sessions scattered around the month. But with 4 running sessions per week, most of my workouts have been walks and I've been wanting to increase the \"level\" of physical activity for now because I feel like I can and want to do a bit more.\nJust explaining this here if it helps with context",
