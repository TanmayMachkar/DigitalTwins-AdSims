      "selftext": "I, 23F, started running about a week ago (running clubs are cool!). I tried to run before, I really liked the feeling right after the run, but after a couple of days my back started to hurt and I quit. This time I started classes as part of a program for the local community with a professional coach. And in recent days, I've been having thoughts: I hated running as a teenager, and all because they didn't teach us how to run properly at my school. I don't understand why children aren't taught proper running techniques and proper stretching as part of the school program (I asked few friends, they had exactly the same thing). I think I would have started running much earlier if I had learned how to run properly. It turns out that your back may not hurt from running! It turns out that you can breathe easily, even if you run for 15 minutes in a row! All these discoveries have appeared in my life in the last week and seriously, having a coach makes a big difference in your training.",
