      "selftext": "I live in Miami. Heat index is in the mid 90s right now and 77% humidity and I attempted 5x800 meters at 5k pace at the track\u2026 I got in 3 before I felt like I wanted to puke. I\u2019ve been doing speed on the tread all summer because of the heat. I\u2019m currently training to get into Boston so, the speed work is FAST and HARD. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss of if I should keep doing speed on the treadmill until it finally cools down (November/December) or if doing it indoors v outdoors is a disservice to my goals? Feeling frustrated ",
