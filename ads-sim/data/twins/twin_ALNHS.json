      "selftext": "Hi so I\u2019ve gotten through winter in Ireland this year without buying a jacket. However I\u2019ve increased my mileage to 100k ish a week so I can\u2019t avoid not having one. Looking for recommendations for a good quality waterproof running jacket don\u2019t mind spending money on it once it\u2019s pretty waterproof and will last. Thanks in advance for any recommendation\u2019s.",
