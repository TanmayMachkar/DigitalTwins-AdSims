I\u2019ve had friends recommend vests with water bottles at the front but I\u2019m not sure how comfortable or practical those are for women with breasts (GG) and can\u2019t ask without commenting on their chest (which I\u2019d rather not do).\n\nMy sports bra is on point, no aches or pains or anything really just looking for tips and recommendations for lugging some water with me without having too much weight or bulk please \u263a\ufe0f",
