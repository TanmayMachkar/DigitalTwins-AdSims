So while I could always have fun on a 3-4 mile casual run with friends, I never really improved fitness or got faster.\u00a0\n\nIn February 2024, I had a great time training for and running a 10-mile race and managed to maintain around 10-15 miles per week for the rest of the year.\n\nI started training in earnest at the end of January, but viewed it more as a fun way to increase my mileage. I ran 4 times a week, maintaining about 20 miles per week, consistently increasing my long runs every weekend while doing some tempo treadmill runs. My longest run was 11 miles, two weeks away from the race. Throughout this process I lifted 2-3 times per week and took a hot yoga class every week or two.\u00a0\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI stayed over at my girlfriend's mom\u2019s house in Annapolis the night before the race. We went out to dinner, where I had an (extremely mid) pita + hummus plate and french fries. I went to bed at 10 p.m.\n\nWhen my alarm went off at 5:15 a.m., I felt super tired and heavy. But I drank a yerba mate, ate a banana with sunflower seed butter, and put on my race fit and bib, and felt a lot better.\n\nMy girlfriend\u2019s mom graciously dropped me off at 6:15 a.m. It was still dark out, but nice to use the porta potties without a line and jog around for a few minutes. They also had a sock burning fire (it\u2019s an Annapolis tradition to burn your winter socks to welcome spring) to warm up in front of.\n\n# Race\n\nMiles 1\u20134: Easy peasy. I made sure to start the first mile nice and slow. This was a really comfortable pace without too many hills.\n\nMiles 4\u20136: We hit the Navy Bridge, which is a particularly nasty hill! Luckily I took my first gel with 35mg of caffeine, and the (mostly placebo) effect got me up it, plus the thrill of passing people. I started to feel a little uncomfortable with the rolling hills, but in good spirits.\u00a0\n\nMile 6\u20138: We enter an out-and-back on the B&A trail, a paved trail that goes through nature and residential areas. Even though I now feel like I\u2019m racing and not just on a long run, it was really refreshing and lovely to hear bird calls and see the beginning of spring. This is when I started to pass people. I would set my sights on someone who looked pretty athletic and think \u201cawesome, I\u2019m going to follow them for the rest of the race.\u201d But then I would just\u2026 go faster! It was a nice ego boost. I also took my second gel.\u00a0\n\nMiles 8\u201310: Time to lock the fuck in. I put my headphones on for the first time and bump ericdoa. I\u2019m pushing, but these two miles are a mild downhill.\n\nMiles 11\u201312: Back on the Navy Bridge. Everything hurts and I\u2019m furious about everyone who has ever wronged me.\u00a0\n\nFinal 0.1 miles: This was bruuuutal. They had us go uphill and through an unaesthetic parking lot to get to the finish line! I really pushed myself to cross the finish line.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI was honestly in shock at my time! Throughout training I was expecting to eek out 2:30 \u2013 and totally not expecting to run under 10:00 pace for the last three miles. I grabbed the post-race goodies and asked a stranger to take a picture of me with my medal before my girlfriend\u2019s mom picked me back up.\n\nI drove the hour home, showered/walked the dog, and met friends for brunch and devoured a waffle, Impossible sausage patty, and iced lavender latte. Weirdly enough, my left IT band felt really painful \u2013 it\u2019s bothered me in the past, but hasn\u2019t flared up in more than a year. It\u2019s only 7 hours post-finish, so we\u2019ll see how I feel tomorrow.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m pretty jazzed, honestly, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s another race or time that I should set my sights on. I have to train for a Grand Canyon Rim-to-River hike next month, but after that, I\u2019m wondering: Do I try for a faster half? Faster 10k? Or go longer and do my first marathon? Either way, maintaining consistent mileage per week paid off, and I definitely want to stay around 15-20 mpw until I decide what to do next.\n\n*Edited for fuck-ass formatting*",
