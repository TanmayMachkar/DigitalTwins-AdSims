      "selftext": "Let's say someone like me, a 27 year old male, wants to run a BQ. Based on my current fitness, a 3:55 marathon three years ago and a 2:15 half recently (I gained some weight and got really out of shape), that is at least 3+ years away. What is the best way to approach a goal that is such a long ways off?\n\nSetting intermediate goals is a no brainer, but what should the process look like? Should there be periodization where you focus on speed, like 5k training, and periods where you focus on endurance by running intermediate half and full marathons? Should you just keep stacking on miles, doing your 3 easy runs, a speed workout, and your long run until you get there? \n\nSimply put, what's the best approach for attacking those super long term goals?",
