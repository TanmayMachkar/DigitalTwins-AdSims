      "selftext": "I know this might be a bit of an odd comparison, but I\u2019m curious how others would describe the difference in effort between these two paths:\n\n* Going from *couch to your first marathon*, vs\n* Going from *having completed your first marathon* to completing your *first full Ironman*.\n\nI imagine they\u2019re tough in different ways, but I\u2019d love to hear personal takes on which felt more challenging \u2014 physically, mentally, logistically, etc.\n\nBonus points if you've done both!",
