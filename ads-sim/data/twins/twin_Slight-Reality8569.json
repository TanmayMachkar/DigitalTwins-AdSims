      "selftext": "Hey, Gang! My gf is training for her first marathon in Sacramento in December. Shes working really hard and am really proud of her commitment. She just ran 16mi last weekend and then woke up today to find out that the friends who she signed up with to do the marathon with decided to bail. She is very very down and the training has already been exhausting for her. I wanting to get he a care package to encourage her to keep going and complete this goal and also a care package for when she does! So, what are some of the best things you have received during training and after your race? I want to do something special and figured you guys would know what a runner needs/wants most.",
