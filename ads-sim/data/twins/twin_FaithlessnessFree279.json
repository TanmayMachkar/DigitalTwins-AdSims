      "selftext": "Hi!\n\n I just finished my first marathon this past weekend (Canberra, April 13) and am so excited for the next!\n\n  \nI didn't sign up for any others this year because I wanted to see how I went with Canberra first, and  Sydney, Melbourne & Gold coast are all sold out by now.\n\n\n\nI'm hoping to do one of them next year - and/or save for a NZ marathon ! -  but I want another goal to work towards this year (at least 3 months away) in the meantime, preferably NSW or ACT but open to VIC, SA & QLD (anywhere a short-ish trip from Sydney)\n\n  \nI was wondering if anyone has done any of the following and has any insight/recommendations (elevation, size, weather, crowd vibes etc) ? Last i checked these all had places still available :)\n\n  \nWinery Run, Hunter Valley (NSW)  July 20th\n\nShepparton Running Festival (VIC) - August 17th\n\nMoolarben Marathon, Mudgee Running Festival (NSW) - August 17th\n\nBarossa Marathon Festival (SA) - August 24th\n\nCoffs Harbour Anytime Fitness Marathon (NSW) - September 14th\n\nRun Shellharbour (NSW) - September 28th\n\nRun Husky, Huskisson/Jervis Bay (NSW) - November 1st\n\nThe Run, Port Stephens (NSW) - November 23rd\n\n  \nThank you so much for any help!\n\n",
