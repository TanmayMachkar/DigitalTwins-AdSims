      "selftext": "I feel like it is a common joke among runners about how much we hate taking the time to do strength training or stretching. Personally, I have had so many false starts - I tell myself, \"this is the week\" and I maybe get through a half-hearted session or two, but then I just completely lose interest. It's so boring. It's so repetitive. And running is SO MUCH MORE FUN!\n\nAnd yet... I'm constantly getting annoying injuries. One months it's ITBS. The next it's PFPS. Next my hip starts hurting out of nowhere. I've managed to adjust my running and still complete a couple marathons over the last year, but these injuries are such a drag.\n\nSo I'm curious to hear - if you're someone who used to hate strength and stretching, but it's now a regular part of your routine, how'd you do it?! What changed? What enables you to be consistent? Was it finding the right plan (and please feel free to drop your plan in the comments!)? Was it seeing results? Was it something else?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you in the hopes that I can finally, finally, finally achieve a more well-rounded routine. Thanks :)",
