I actually love the quiet streets and cooler weather, but I\u2019ve noticed I have a harder time falling asleep afterward. It makes me wonder if those late runs are helping or hurting in the long run. Do any of you run late at night, and if so, how do you manage recovery and sleep?",

      "selftext": "Been running consistently for 6+ years now , everything from 5Ks to marathons and lately I\u2019ve noticed my relationship with running changing.  Just curious for those of you who\u2019ve been running a while:  \nHas your *why* evolved too? What keeps you lacing up these days? Would love to hear different perspectives from newer and long-time runners alike.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nAfter running consistently for the past few years, I hit a wall earlier this year. I was mentally and physically drained, and what used to bring me joy started feeling like a chore. I decided to take a break, thinking it\u2019d be just a couple of weeksbut that turned into months. Now I\u2019m finally ready to lace up again, but I feel a bit lost. My pace is slower, endurance is down, and honestly, I\u2019m a little nervous to jump back in. I don\u2019t want to fall into the same trap again.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve experienced burnout I wanna know how did you reset your mindset? Any routines or fun running goals that helped you reignite the spark? Would you recommend starting with group runs, trail runs, or just solo easy miles? Thanks in advance!",
