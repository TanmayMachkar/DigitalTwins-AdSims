      "selftext": "Getting some opinions - I tore and got surgery on my hip labrum last year. I've recently been cleared to run at full capacity again and start training for a half in October this week.\n\nRight before I got injured, I was doing my speedwork in the Altra Vanish Tempo. They have under 50 miles on them (life is 250-300), but my first run in them was back in March 2024. I have heard you're not supposed to wear shoes over a year old even if they haven't been worn much because the foam can still break down. Am obviously hesitant to do anything that can cause issues with being out of running for 7+ months with such a severe injury (and am probably babying my hip a little, lol.)\n\nWould you wear those shoes? Or would you look at investing in another pair for this training cycle?",
