      "selftext": "Hi i ran a 25:49 5k or 8:20/mi and i can run to 6 miles at 9:50/mi\n\nEvery morning when I run I do a warm up routine beforehand:\n\n1. 5 minute slow jog\n\n2. Some stationary stretches\n\n3. 4x 25 meter sprints with light dynamic stretches\n\nI see online that a lot of runners only do some dynamic stretches like hamstring sweeps or some even don't warm up at all, which makes me think my warm up routine might be excessive or too little. I do the same for all my runs: 3 miles 400m intervals 25min tempo or 5-7mi long runs\n\nFor me I can't run effectively without some stretching\n\nI'd also like to hear your warm ups too i can try \ud83d\ude0a",
