      "selftext": "Good morning everyone. I had a rather devastating start to the day with Carmel Marathon being cancelled due to thunderstorms. I imagine many are in the same boat- spent the last 5 months training and flew to Indiana this weekend. No other marathon quite fits my schedule and it will be hard for me to continue training with the upcoming travel I have and starting medical school in July. I am feeling absolutely gutted. I was considering running the 26 on my own tomorrow, but that's essentially what I did for my first marathon (there were only 80 participants and no spectators), and I was really excited to see what I could do with pacers/ adrenaline/overall better vibes. Anyone ever have this experience before and have any words of wisdom? Or anyone want to rip a marathon with me tomorrow lol.. kidding.........",
