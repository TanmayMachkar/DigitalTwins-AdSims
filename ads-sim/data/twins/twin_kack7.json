      "selftext": "Hi all, I\u2019m new to this subreddit so forgive me if this post should be somewhere else or if this question has been asked and answered. \n\nDoes anyone have any good recommendations for 2 in 1 shorts where the liner actually has good compression? I currently wear fabletics, and they\u2019ve been fine for me 2-4 mile runs, but I reached 6 miles for the first time about a week ago and the shorts were getting a little uncomfy at the longer distance. \n\nAnyone have any good recs or should I just switch to regular shorts with real compression shorts under instead of 2 in 1? \n\nEdit: Thanks so much for all the replies everyone! This is all very helpful information. I\u2019m gonna have to try some of these out ",
