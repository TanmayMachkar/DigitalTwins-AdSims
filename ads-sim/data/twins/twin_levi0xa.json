      "selftext": "I started training for a half marathon since the beginning of summer after not running since right before COVID. \nOne thing I\u2019ve noticed is that while doing my long runs, I tend to either walk or stop the run completely despite not feeling physically tired. I feel like my mind controls my run far more than me. \nDo you guys have any tips on completing long runs without stopping? I\u2019ve tried listening to podcasts but I still feel like I can\u2019t block out my mind wandering and telling me to stop.",
