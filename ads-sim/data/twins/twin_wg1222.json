      "selftext": "This year London Marathon has a new Green Team for runners choose not to have kitbag drop. Green uses blue start line.\n\nWith a 2:45 estimated finish time, I have been assigned to Green Wave 1. However, the start time is 9:52-9:54, which is almost 20min late than other wave 1 starts. This means if you are fast runners in Green then 100% you will have to run with runner at much slower pace then you.\n\nAs I did my research, Blue, Pink, Yellow wave 1 all start at 9:35-9:39. \nGreen wave 2 start at ~10:17, almost the same time as Blue wave 10.\n\nWhat London Marathon organizers did was to put sub 3 runners behind 3:00-3:30 groups in such a bit event. This not only creates safety issues but also punish people who chose to go green. \n\nNote: they did also promise that choosing Green wont impact start time. Apparently NOT true! \n\nMaybe the organizers just dont care because the fast runners in Green is only a small group, they care more about marketing. They even came up with a separate participant guide for Team Green. The content of which is mostly the same as the regular participant guid\u2026.  \n\nCOMPLETE wave start time and pacer information are posted here:\n[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/s/fs79V0KJ0m)\n\nUpdate: London Marathon organizers have just sent out updated start time to affected Team Green runners",
