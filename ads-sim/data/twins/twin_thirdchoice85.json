Maybe you met during a training program, a fun run, or through a local running club?\n\nI\u2019ve recently gotten into running not just for health but also for community. It\u2019s been surprisingly fulfilling, and it got me thinking how many people have built deeper connections from simply sharing miles.\n\nWould love to hear your stories \u2014 not just romantic, but any meaningful human connection you\u2019ve built because of running. \ud83d\ude0a  \nAlso open to any advice on how to make the most of group runs if you're new and hoping to connect with others!",
