      "selftext": "I\u2019m a new runner (started in January of this year) and just completed my first half yesterday. I absolutely loved it but my stomach is 100% my worst enemy when it comes to running. I struggle having any fuel when I run. I\u2019ve gotten the pre run breakfast in the bag so that\u2019s a tick but I really struggle with the feeling during. I had a gel before we started and then one half an hour in but that one hit my stomach wrong and felt I couldn\u2019t take another in case I vomited which might have possibly been why I completely bonked at about mile 10 and I was too worried about having any of the sweets people were handing out. I managed to dig deep and got myself a PB but I have a full marathon I\u2019m hoping to do next year and will obviously need to fuel myself better. I\u2019ve seen something about \u201ctraining\u201d your tummy but I have no idea where to even start with this? Any experience or tips would be massively helpful!! Struggling to find info on it as i keep getting ab workouts \ud83e\udd72",
