      "selftext": "This last week, I've been getting back into running and I honestly forgot how good it feels. I used to run a bit before COVID and enjoyed it, but stopped and haven't really done it for years. Over the last few months, I've tried to start up again, but only went on runs every couple of weeks. This week I've been going out every day and it feels so good!\n\nI know pretty much every doctor tells you that running is good for your mental health, but I think this is the first time I've actually felt the difference. I had one moment today where I had a really intense burst of happiness after weeks of stress and it made me realise for the first time ever that I genuinely love running and I'm not just lying to myself to get me to do it!\n\nI've never been a very active person, but running has made me feel so much better about myself in ways I never thought were possible. It just makes me feel so free and happy and powerful, and I never want to stop!\n\nWhat was a moment that made you realise you actually love running?",
