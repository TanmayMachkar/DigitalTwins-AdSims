      "selftext": "I downloaded Running (then Runtastic) >10 years ago when it was the only app available. At the time I paid for it a flat fee, and have been able to use it on every device I used ever since, which sounds great.\n\nI have not been running consistently, but every now and then I keep going back to it, while also doing other forms of excercise.\n\nI am now a mom to a 2 YO and I find that running is the easiest way to get some excercise, so I am getting more and more into it. I still use Runningt by Adidas, but I am not too happy with the training programs they have on the app.\n\nI read somewhere that they were planning on phasing it out at some point in 2025.\n\nOn the positive side though it is a completely free to use app, as I bought it once and do not have an ongoing subscription. \n\n  \nSo my dilemma is I would like to try another running app, that might be better at tracking and with better training programs (I have done 5k and 10k runs in the past, and would love to try a half marathon!), but at the same time, is it really worth getting a subscription app just for a small improvement? Is it a small improvement?",
