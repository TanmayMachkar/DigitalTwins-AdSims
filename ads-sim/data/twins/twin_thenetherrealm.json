      "selftext": "So, for context, 32M. Started running 2 years ago, stopped after 3 months. 1 year ago, stopped again after 4 months. Around February/March this year I restarted for the third time, and I\u2019m starting to enjoy it for once! Plan is to do a 5k race every 4-6 weeks to keep me motivated. However, what I\u2019m starting to realise is I\u2019m just feeling perpetually\u2026 underwhelmed? Disappointed? I don\u2019t know the right term. \n\nRegardless of how much I improve, I just can\u2019t feel happy about it. When I started back running in February, I was doing a 28 minute 5k. By my first race in May, I was down to 24:56. My PB from 2024 was 24:32, so I wasn\u2019t happy with that. I started training properly (intervals, etc. which I had never done) with the goal of going sub 24 by my next race in late June. I got 23:18, well under my target\u2026 and I was just disappointed I didn\u2019t get sub-23. Everyone was celebrating, people delighted going sub 30, sub 28 etc. and I was just there being like \u201cright, not good enough. Sub 22:30 by July race\u201d.\n\nSet a goal, beat it, be disappointed, set new goal.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle, and I just want to know is it typical? Do you ever feel content with your running? Or is it always \u201cmust do better\u201d? I don\u2019t mind it, I just thought I\u2019d feel happy with each milestone and I don\u2019t. ",
