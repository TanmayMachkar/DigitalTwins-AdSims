      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I been into running for the past 3 years. It\u2019s just a personal hobby but I really love it. I\u2019m in my late 20s and I run regularly, planning my own distances depending on where I am. Not training for races or anything, just doing it for myself. I also eat really clean, no processed sugar or packaged stuff. Everything is homemade and natural. I want to keep that same approach when running longer distances. I\u2019ve done some 20km+ runs and now I want to bring food with me. I seen runners use gels and energy drinks, but I\u2019m looking for natural options only. Nothing artificial. So what natural food do you recommend during a long run? And when should I eat it if I\u2019m going 20km or more?",
