      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm running a marathon later this month in Morocco, and I really want to use the opportunity to raise money for a charity. The marathon itself doesn\u2019t offer any built-in fundraising options, so I\u2019m trying to figure out how to do it independently. One challenge is that I\u2019m not active on any social media, so I can\u2019t rely on that to spread the word.\n\nAre there any platforms/channels that support personal fundraising campaigns for charitable causes?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or experiences you can share!\n\nThanks in advance!",
