      "selftext": "Hey everyone\u2014curious to hear from folks who\u2019ve taken extended time off from running, either from injury, burnout, or just life stuff.\n\nI had to take a long break this year after a tough race left me completely drained. Coming back has been a mix of excitement and mental hurdles. I\u2019ve been easing back in with shorter runs and no pressure on pace\u2014but sometimes I still feel like a beginner all over again.\n\nI\u2019m wondering what helped you the most during your own comeback\u2014was it mindset shifts, certain types of runs, reconnecting with your community, or something else entirely?\n\nWould love to hear how others found their rhythm again.",
