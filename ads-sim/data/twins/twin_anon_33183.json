      "selftext": "Just curious... I'm going to do my second marathon at the end of the month and the bus leaves for the start line bright and early at 4:30am.  Is it worth it to adjust my sleep schedule and training runs a week ahead of time so that I'm waking up at 4am and running by 6am? Thanks in advance for any advice or tips on the best way to do this \n\nEdit: Thanks everyone who responded for providing your advice. I ended up focusing on getting better sleep for the week leading up to the run and moved going to bed about an hour earlier but nothing too drastic. Just finished the run and it went well after about five hours of sleep from 10pm-3am. ",
