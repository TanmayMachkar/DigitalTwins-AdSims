      "selftext": "William Goodge is currently running across Australia.14days in and he's still looking strong, with crazy numbers on strava. \n\nI'm genuinely impressed with what he's doing and what he's done in the past. But, as some concerns arise, i don't really understand why he doesn't simply give proof that it's real, it doesn't seem that hard to do. I feel like it would even silence the haters and gain in media visibility/popularity, and probably raise more money for charity\n\nWhat he is trying to achieving obviously very impressive, so why making it suspicious?\n\nWhat are the opinions of experienced runners/ultra runners on what he is doing?\n",
