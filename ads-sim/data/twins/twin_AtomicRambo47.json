      "selftext": "Hello, I\u2019m relatively new to running, but my big toe nails, specifically ONLY on the INNER side of the big toe nail (next to 2nd toe) are getting purple and very painful. I\u2019d estimate about 1/3 of the nail is turning purple, area closest to 2nd toe. It happens on both feet.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to solve this issue for months and can\u2019t find any discussions of someone having this specific issue. I\u2019ve tried 3 different sizes of shoes, tons of socks, but it\u2019ll still happen even after a 5-6 mile run. I have other foot issues too like blisters but recently found some relief from Balega Blister resist. Thicker sock seems to help way better than the thin feetures. I\u2019ve also tried different shoe brands and Hokas have been the best, although I\u2019m open to trying something new again if needed.\n\nI tried the heel lock method but that made my heel hurt because it was so tight. I am almost 100% confident this issue is not caused by my toes hitting the front of the shoe because otherwise it would be the whole nail, or at least the front. Anybody have a clue what\u2019s going on? I keep my toe nails very trim, and I don\u2019t have this issue on any other toes whatsoever.\n\nI\u2019ve been contemplating trying the silicon toe caps. Would this have something to do with insoles? Why is this happening only after a few miles? It\u2019s stopping me from progressing in distance. I\u2019d upload a photo but it doesn\u2019t let me\u2026 Any help of feedback is appreciated, thank you!",
