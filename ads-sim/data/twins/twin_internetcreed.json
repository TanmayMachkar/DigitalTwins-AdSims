      "selftext": "Can anyone give insight/personal experiences on running after fueling up on junk foods? For example, if I eat 10 cookies, a pint of ice cream, candy, ect., and meet my calorie needs for a 5 mile run, how does that effect the run, if at all? \n\nAlthough I used extreme food examples, there are days where I will eat mostly \u2018empty caloric\u2019 foods and skip my planned run based on the assumption that I would not be able to complete it. I haven\u2019t found any answers about this specific question and was wondering if anyone has done this before and what the run was like. Thanks! ",
