      "selftext": "Let me just say, the things we do for these stubborn joints of ours. \n\n\n\nSo, I recently stumbled across a water treadmill in a hotel gym. Imagine the regular treadmill you know, but this one is inside a tank with water up to your waist, like something out of a film, honestly. The trainer was full of promises: \u201cIt is gentle on the knees! You still sweat! You will thank me!\u201d You know how these gym people be, always with the big talk. But I am skeptical by nature. Is it really that different from cycling, or even rowing, which I can do at home while my mother yells at me to fetch water? \n\n\n\nI went down an internet hole searching for opinions, and somehow I ended up reading a review on Alibaba about gym mats. I even asked around. My friend tried the water treadmill after a football injury. He said it was alright, but after two weeks, he quietly returned to his old routines, as if nothing happened. \n\n\n\nSo, has anyone here actually used a water treadmill at all? Is it worth the hype, or should I just stick to my stubborn bicycle? Please, I need honest opinions.",
