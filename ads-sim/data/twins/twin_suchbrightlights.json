Sort questions by new so that they get some love.\n\nTo the more experienced runnitors, if something is a good question or answer, add it to the FAQ.\n\nPost your question -- stupid or otherwise -- here to get an answer -- stupid or otherwise. Anyone can post a question and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get a lot of action, so if your question didn't get answered, feel free to post it again.\n\nAs always, be sure to read the FAQ first. Also, there's a handy-dandy search bar to your right, and if you didn't know, you can also use Google to search runnit by using the limiter \"site:reddit.com [r/running](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/)\".\n\nBe sure to check back often as questions get posted throughout the day. Sort comments by \"new\" to be sure the newer questions get some love as well.\n\n\\[Posting on behalf of u/30000lbs_of_bananas who is busy testing the recovery benefits of pastries vs. burritos, for science.\\]",
