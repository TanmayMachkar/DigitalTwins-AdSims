      "selftext": "I'm a dark skin black woman, 25, 5\u201d2, 55kg and I run around 4-5 times a week.\n\nI used the apple watch SE for 4 years before upgrading to the Garmin 265s in February of this year. My main reason for leaving the apple eco system is that I was convinced my heart rate was just so off. \n\nWhenever I would race a 5k my average heart rate would be 200bpm (about 3-5bpm off my max heart rate) and around 180-198bpm on most other runs. Obviously this is very high and I was convinced I was fitter than this.\n\nI've seen a slight improvement since switching to garmin. With an average HR of 166bpm on an easy 10mile run.\n\nI've seen some people on here say they only noticed a discrepancy of around 5bpm when using a chest strap compared to an optical watch sensor. I've assumed that most of the people in these discussions are fairer skinned.\n\nTL/DR\nBasically my question is, for other black people, have you noticed a difference in the heart rate measurement when using a chest strap compared to a watch?\n\nObviously non-black people feel free to weigh in with your own experience and expertise!",
