      "selftext": "Everyone kept telling me \"just stretch more,\" but every time I did those long hamstring or hip stretches pre-run, my lower back literally flared up, and I'd be totally miserable.\n\nWent to see a DPT and he said I was actually loosening the only support my body had! Started focusing on core stability before running recently and it's been a game-changer for me.\n\nWish the pop knowledge about \"just stretching\" were a little more specific. Hope you're all out there doing it properly and focusing on your core. My lower back is thanking me now.",
