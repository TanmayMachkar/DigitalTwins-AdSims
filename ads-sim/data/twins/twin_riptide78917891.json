      "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have started to use carbs in my training recently and have felt a massive benefit but I'm a broke college student so i started to look for ways to make it more cost effective. I've been using the *Flow Formulas* gel mix and find that it works well for me and I had the thought after looking at the ingredients list that I could probably make it myself. I'm sure that I am not the first to think of this but I went ahead and spent an hour doing math and browsing amazon and created a formulation and produce list. Here is the link to my spreadsheet for any interested. \n\nfor use you can buy reusable gel flasks for like 8$. just mix with warm water(amount depends on your preferred texture just experiment) shake and let sit for 5 mins. \n\nI am also open to any suggestions for improvements or fixes to possible mistakes I made in the spreadsheet.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18h8lfPGE9jfJ97mVZk4rsZ4DB8cxCmeMS5TGFqvzxCE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18h8lfPGE9jfJ97mVZk4rsZ4DB8cxCmeMS5TGFqvzxCE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAlso I don't have affiliate links or any of the BS so I'm not trying to make money off this. \n\nThanks.
