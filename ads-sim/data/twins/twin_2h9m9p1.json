      "selftext": "I've been running for 6 months, the last 2.5 months of that outdoors, and can comfortably do x3 10k/week - taking about 1hr10m. Looking for sub 1hr (for now, but thinking long term strategies) \n\nMy circular route around my house is very hilly and so my pace varies wildly in line with the undulations (04:45-11:00min/km).\n\nMy question is, how do I incorporate tempo and interval runs when the terrain (i.e. tree roots to trip up on), and elevation gain/loss, dictate my speed.\n\nMy nearest track is a 45 minute drive away and there isn't really anywhere flat to try out speed work within walking distance.\n\nI presume others have a similar issue, so how do you adapt your routine? Or have I just missed a key bit of reading?\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to find this question among the threads.\n\n\nThanks in advance :)",
