      "selftext": "I\u2019m super new to running, and my first 5k race is coming up. I know the route, and it\u2019s not my usual running place. Would it be better to run it once in advance, or just do it for the first time the day of the race? This is less of a physical inquiry and more of a question of if knowing makes it easier or more difficult mentally on race day. Thanks!\n\nedit: the race is on my college campus so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the terrain, I\u2019ve just never run the whole thing at once\n\nPost Race Update: The comments were mixed, but the majority said it helps, so I ended up running it in advance and it definitely helped me mentally. I wouldn\u2019t say it was something that I needed to do but it gave me a little boost to have mental checkpoints. I ended up running it one minute faster than I\u2019d ran the 5k before so I was super excited! I appreciate all of your guys\u2019 help!\n",
