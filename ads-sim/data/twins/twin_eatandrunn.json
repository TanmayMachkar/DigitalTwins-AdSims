      "selftext": "I\u2019m toying with the idea of starting a local running group (club? Not sure what the difference is, really\u2026) in my local area of town.\n\nI just thought I\u2019d ask the community here if there are any tips/thoughts/advice that might be helpful.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to charge dues or have this club be anything big or elite. Just trying to invite the community out for some group runs on a local trail. We have a coffee shop/brewery right next to the trail so I thought I\u2019d have that be a pre- or post-run spot to hang\u2026 but I also wonder if the association/affiliation w this spot could be problematic in some way\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll hit bumps along the way but I just thought I\u2019d seek advice/help from this sub. Apologies if this is not the place to post something like this. Appreciate any help! \n\n",
