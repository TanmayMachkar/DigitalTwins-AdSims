She is a three-time Olympic and multiple-time World Champion.\n\nIt seems like it\u2019s a setup similar to Breaking2, (which I loved watching) but unfortunately the run won\u2019t count as an official record due to the pacing assistance, but none the less it\u2019s still a huge moment for the sport.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think, can she break 4? And if she does, how much closer does it bring us to someone doing it in a record-eligible race?",
