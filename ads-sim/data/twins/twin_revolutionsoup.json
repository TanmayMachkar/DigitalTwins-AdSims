      "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all, new to running and new to the subreddit! I\u2019m also recently (2022) diagnosed autistic. One of my major sensory sensitivities is wind/air currents. They make my ears hurt and make me feel really sick if they touch my skin, especially while biking, running, or being at the beach/an open area. The problem is that I hate running on treadmills due to poor balance and love running in nature. Does anyone have ways they accommodate sensory sensitivities while running? Or any ideas on some things that might help?",
