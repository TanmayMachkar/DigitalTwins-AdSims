      "selftext": "Not taking anything away from Sawe, Kiplimo, etc, of course, because they are absolutely PHENOMENAL athletes, but it made me realise again how generational Kiptum was. His trajectory from debut to inevitable sub 2 was just astonishing, and made me realise how there are still hugely distinct levels even in the elite categories.\n\nI think I feel this way part because of the hype surrounding Kiplimo potentially going sub 2 in his debut, which of course didn't happen, and in comparison, Kiptum's debut was nearly 2 minutes faster. Just insane.\n\nI feel we'll still see a ratified sub 2 in the next 5 years but think we would have had it already if Kiptum was still around. He was just that different.",
