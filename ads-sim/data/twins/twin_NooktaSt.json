      "selftext": "10k is my preferred distance. I am looking for something in a city centre that has a fun atmosphere, ideally a big crowd.\n\nI have done the Vancouver Sun Run a few times and it's great, about 45k and a great way to see the city. Do any European cities have similar. Might make hotels more expensive but I like the idea of the event being a big thing in the city vs something in a park outside the city.  \nNo issue if its on the same time as a half or marathon.",
