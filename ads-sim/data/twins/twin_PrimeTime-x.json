      "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nim interested to hear your opinion on using AI (ChatGPT) as a coach to help you achieve your running goals. If you have used AI for this purpose, what exactly did you do with it and were you satisfied?  \nFor contexct: Im a 23 year old Male (hobby)-runner and i would describe myself as good for my age group but not a top athlete. I have used ChatGPT to vary my training for my half marathon PR (1:53:46) and currently finishing a 6 week plan from ChatGPT for an upcomming 5k and i am more than happy with it. Sometimes i also use it to help me to optimize my nutrition and sports psychologie related stuff :)\n\nSo what's your opinion?",
