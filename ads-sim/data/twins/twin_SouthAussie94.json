      "selftext": "> An avid trail runner is mapping every twist and turn of the trails around Brisbane's Mount Coot-tha in an effort to bring much-needed precision to the growing sport.\n\n> University of Queensland research scientist Raimundo Sanchez has covered the trails hundreds of times with a professional GPS.\n\n> Unlike a regular marathon or running event that can be measured using a calibrated bicycle, accurately measuring trail runs is an endeavour in science and technology.\n\n> Full Article: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-28/trail-running-international-standard-mapping-olympics-push/105308848\n\nI'm a trail runner and a surveyor so I understand the difficulties of measuring a trail running course accurately. \n\nIt makes me wonder how they measure and standardise the course for Mountain Biking? I would have thought the Mountain Biking course could also be suitable for Trail Running?\n\nInteresting!",
