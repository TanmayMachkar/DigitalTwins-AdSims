      "selftext": "I started running last year and this is my first year of entering races.\n\nEvery race I\u2019ve run bar one (which weirdly enough was my longest, a half marathon) I have felt seriously dehydrated afterwards. I\u2019m talking headache, nausea, upset stomach, sometimes chills, general shittiness.\n\nI don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong; I drink a lot of water throughout the day usually, minimum of 2L a day, and I make sure to drink before/during the race, including with electrolytes. After the race today, I drank 1.5L in the car alone, and then water at home, before the headache kicked in.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to say that I sweat A LOT. I always have done - I just get SO hot. Like sometimes I feel like my head is gonna pop with the heat, and it\u2019s the heat I struggle with before anything else when I\u2019m running.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to have to stop races because I love them, but this is getting really difficult to deal with and it ruins the experience for me. Any advice will be appreciated!",
