      "selftext": "I've been running for 2 months, I ran my last parkrun in 24:45, and I would like to train 2-3 days a week to bring my time down to about 22 min. \n\nThe problem is, I'm now back in my hometown, where it's nearly impossible to find a flat path. After three attempts at running 5k at my race pace, I finally managed to get under 25 min again, but had to walk several times to recover during the run, which didn't happen in my last parkruns. I tried my first 'long' run today, but I really struggled to find a conversational pace when going uphill and had to walk to stop gasping for air. I only did 7k in 46 min, probably less than 6k of actual running, with an elevation gain of 183 m, and I feel more tired than I should after an easy long run. \n\nThere are a lot of threads here about the optimal pace for a long run, which usually recommend going 1-1:30 min/mile slower than racing pace, but I haven't found much advice about hilly terrain, especially for inexperienced runners. So my question is: does a conversational pace even exist when running such steep roads as a beginner/intermediate? Should I just drive somewhere flatter to run, or should I stick to the hills and try to find a slower, comfortable pace?",
