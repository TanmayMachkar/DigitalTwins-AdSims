      "title": "Have We Been Tricked by Running Shoe Companies? Do Super Cushioned Shoes Actually Reduce Injuries?",
      "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about all the hype around running shoes over the past 10years. Super cushioned soles, maximalist shoes, \u201csuper shoes\u201d with carbon plate. It\u2019s like every brand promises we\u2019ll run faster and stay injury-free if we just buy the latest pair.\n\nBut has any of this actually reduced injury rates? From what I\u2019ve read, the answer seems\u2026 not really. I\u2019m in my forties and returning to running having been out of the game for 8 years and it is so strange going to the specialist stores, the sole thickness is off the charts and the staff are describing the benefits in almost exact opposite terms to the early 2000s. My preference has always been to have a good feel for the ground, not in a barefoot running way but in a what I would class as normal sole kind of way but options like that seem long gone. So, what do you all think, have we been duped or are maximalist shoes truly better? Lightweight as a goal always made more sense to me than bulky and squidgy.",
