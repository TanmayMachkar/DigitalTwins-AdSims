      "selftext": "I can do 15 miles at an 11 minute pace, which is a speed that will earn you a \u201cD\u201d by high school grading standards. This has stuck with me decades later now. I never made the cut for any sort of track team, will never medal in any local race, and was lousy at gym class. As such I never describe myself as a runner\u2026. Though for years now, I have consistency. I\u2019m not fast but I run regularly and I enjoy it.\n\nRunners magazine arrived this weekend and one article discussed how the author runs 4-5x per week and considers herself a runner. No distance, no pace mentioned. Got me thinking. Is it part of my identity or not?",
