      "selftext": "Has anyone else seen a surge of runners talking about zone 2 training recently?  Just in the past year I\u2019ve heard about it 3 different instances from friends who are very casual runners. I\u2019ve also seen it pop up in my YouTube suggestions.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if there was some new research or maybe an influencer that caused this type of training to boom.\n\nMost of my training comes from the book Faster Road Racing where a zone 2 run would be a recovery run. The book makes it seem like it\u2019s just a way to gain extra mileage in between hard workouts so I can\u2019t understand why it would be popular for runners who aren\u2019t doing structured workouts to begin with.",
