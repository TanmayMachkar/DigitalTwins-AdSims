      "selftext": "I'd like to set a 5k goal for the year, shooting to hit the pace in October, but I'm not sure how to figure out what would be a reasonable target. I'm not very connected to the running community, and I'm not even sure what information someone would need to help me figure out a goal.\n\nI'm 40. I usually only run about 6 months out of the year, running 3 or 4 times a week. I'd like a goal that assumes good consistency but that wouldn't have to become my whole life's focus for the year.\n\nI'm starting off this year in a little better shape than usual. In other years, I'd be struggling to stay under 30 minutes in early April, but yesterday's 5k was 27:33.\n\nThese are my best paces from the last few years:  \n2020: 27:15  \n2021: 27:03  \n2022: 28:15 (I was really into swimming that year)  \n2023: 25:34  \n2024: 24:50\n\nLast year was the first time I had a specific target, and I feel like it helped with motivation. Is this enough information to help figure out a goal?",
