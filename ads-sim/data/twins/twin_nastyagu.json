      "selftext": "Hi all! I was wondering if anyone could recommend a resource that would describe a proper technique for scraping. I\u2019ve heard it might yield good results for older injuries in addition to PT, but can\u2019t seem to find any reliable sources on the actual step-by-step guide on how to do it (pressure, angle, etc). The last reddit posts about scraping on this thread seem to offer a more general discussion of this method. I\u2019d like to attempt it on my hips. Would appreciate any advice or leads!",
