      "selftext": "I've used MMR free for ages but never did the plans until a few weeks ago. I've enjoyed the plans and feel good about the runs I'm going on but I feel like the plans are lacking in depth or much in the way of stats. It seems like other apps, like Runna, are much more adaptive to you and stats-heavy.\n\nNonetheless, really my goal is to build endurance, strength and speed over distance. I just want to be confident I'm doing the right things and running the right speeds/types of runs day in and day out.\n\nWould you suggest I stay with MMR (which is about 1/3 of the cost of Runna) or switch to something else?",
