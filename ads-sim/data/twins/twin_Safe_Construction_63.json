      "selftext": "I spent the past 13 years in NYC, running almost as long, and started attending running clubs maybe four years ago. Running groups are plenty in NYC and tend to be informally organized and smaller (<30 people). Even the most well-known clubs aren't that big. Most groups host runs at least a few times a week and do something after (e.g., a cafe). With the small size, it's super easy to get to know regulars and make friends.\n\nCue my surprise coming out to LA and being told by locals that running is big here. For such a big area, LA really doesn't have many run clubs, and they're all HUGE.  The Venice Run Club apparently gets hundreds of people per run?!  The only run club that size in NYC is Midnight Runners, which I didn't like attending because it's too large and too anonymous.  Run clubs are super polished and manicured, too, with slick websites, branded merchandise, etc.\n\nI'm surprised because LA is huge geographically and there are so many places to run, and commuting sucks--you'd think there would be smaller micro groups, but there aren't (or at least, I have not found them).\n\nThat makes me wonder about running club culture elsewhere. What is it like where you live? Is LA the norm? Is NYC? Somewhere in between?\n\n(Also, if my impression of LA is wrong, please tell me! I really would love to find a smaller running group in West LA to make friends :( )",
