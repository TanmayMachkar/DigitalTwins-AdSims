      "selftext": "I\u2019ve recently started trying to run 5km, but I\u2019m still building up to it. My partner (who\u2019s already really fit) said he\u2019d run with me and support me. At first, he told me I could set the pace and just go at whatever I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nBut lately he\u2019s been pushing us to go faster. I get that it\u2019s good to improve, but honestly, I\u2019m miserable at that faster pace and it just makes me want to quit. Today I slowed it down and actually enjoyed the run and I went for longer than usual and felt proud of myself, but then all he did was complain it was too slow and said he can\u2019t run that slow.\n\nNow I feel kind of deflated instead of happy about my progress, but I do want to get better so should I suck it up and try to push the pace, or just focus on being able to run the full 5km without stopping first and worry about speed later?
