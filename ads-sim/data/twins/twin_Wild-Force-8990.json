      "selftext": "Happy Monday! Back once again! Guys... I strongly dislike the knee sleeves available on the market. Most of them are not designed for runners, and they slip off and/or don't offer enough knee protection. Every time I buy a new one, it's similar to the last one I got, but just a different logo slapped on it. At this rate, I might create my own or something specifically for running. Any wisdom? Still pushing through my runs and even started running barefoot!",
