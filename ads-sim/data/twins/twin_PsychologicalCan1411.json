      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm looking for a detailed training plan to target a **sub-2:45 marathon** at the **Valencia Marathon on December 6, 2025**.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* Male, 1.90m tall, 84kg\n* Current PBs:\n   * **Munich Marathon 2024** \u2013 2:59\n   * **Vienna Marathon April 2025** \u2013 2:56 (goal was 2:52, but I fell short despite a long buildup)\n* For Vienna, I followed Ben Parkes\u2019 sub-2:52 plan and had a solid block, averaging **90\u2013125km per week**\n* Both in Vienna and munich, i had problems with cramping. One reason for this could be that my base endurance is not yet good enough despite my high milage, as I often ran the logruns too fast and didn't train my fat metabolism well enough (zone 2).\n\n**Goals:**\n\n* Go for **2:45 in Valencia**\n* Looking for a **very comprehensive, multi-week plan** (ideally 16\u201320+ weeks)\n* Preferably with emphasis on **structured speed workouts**, **long runs and strength training**\n* Open to advice on how to structure things differently this time (e.g., more tempo work, double runs, strength training, etc.)\n\nAny suggestions, resources, or even custom plans you\u2019ve followed for this kind of leap would be massively appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f",
