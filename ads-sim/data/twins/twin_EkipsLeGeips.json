      "selftext": "I know this has previously been posted about, but a lot of what I read has anecdotally suggested that people run slower on a treadmill than outside.\n\nI been running on the treadmill a bunch recently and have found myself hitting paces that I wouldn\u2019t if I went for a run outside, by about a good minute/mile; does anyone else find this? \n\nIs just a sign that I sign that I\u2019m not pushing myself enough when I run outside and that I should invest in one of those dumb watches so I can push my pace more? But I\u2019m also partially curious whether anyone has actually encountered any studies or anecdotally that running on a treadmill gives you a skewed faster pace. Just thinking of the potential hypotheses for this: on a treadmill you don\u2019t face interruptions for traffic, no wind resistance, and no elevation change. Mostly my concern is, am I artificially inflating my own ego by feeling like I can run faster than I \u201creally\u201d can.",
