      "selftext": "Hello! I couldn't find posts about these two problems together.\n\nMy bunions (hereditary) mean that my feet 'face' in the wrong direction and that my fourth toes end up touching the inside of my shoes. When I start increasing my regular runs towards 10k+ I get blackened toenails on both sides. \n\nI have shoes that seem well fitting and comfy, Nike Pegasus 37 which are so much comfier than the newer versions. I've run less than 200 miles in them.\n\nAnyone else with this dual problem? Do I just have to accept the toe problem or are there *actually shoes that help with this? Wide toe boxes don't solve it.\n\nWhile I'm interested in running a half marathon someday, I need to strengthen some muscles and joints as I'm hypermobile and my body doesnt love long runs. Maybe strength is a thing related to this too?",
