      "selftext": "I\u2019m traveling to Atlanta soon for work and reeaaaally don\u2019t want to take my miles to the treadmill. I\u2019m staying downtown and I\u2019ve used a mix of the Garmin heat maps & strava to determine a route. However, as a female that will be running alone, does anyone have tips/sources for determining a route is safe? (I know safety is a relative term\u2014 for me it\u2019s well-lit & public.) I don\u2019t want to have to ask a city-specific subreddit every time I go somewhere.\n\nFor this specific route, I\u2019m basically planning on weaving through/around Centennial Olympic Park - if anyone has any thoughts on how my run will go there. \n\nEdit: thanks for all of the Atlanta suggestions, but I am looking for general tips that apply anywhere.
