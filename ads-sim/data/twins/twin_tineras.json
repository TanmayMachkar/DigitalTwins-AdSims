      "selftext": "I often get stuck running in the middle of the day in hot Florida and would like something lightweight to wear for sun protection and to still stay cool. I have been wearing tights under shorts or have been using sunscreen, but I've been dealing with some persistent rashes as of late on my legs so I want to try and eliminate the tights and sunscreen and try somethin loose fitting.\n\nI see that people have recommended Janji Transit pants and they look great and all, but I'm a casual runner and would like to NOT spend $100+ on a single pair. If I have to, then I'll buy a single pair, but I was hoping to snag 2-3 pairs at a reasonable price.\n\nI'm 6'0, \\~180lbs, 32in waist. Athletic build. I looked on Amazon, but they have some wacky sizing charts.\n\nThanks!",
