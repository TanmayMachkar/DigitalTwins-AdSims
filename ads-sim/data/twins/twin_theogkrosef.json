Who here suffers from \"exertion headaches\"(...or more like \"exertion pickaxes through the skull\") after long training runs??  \n\n\nI just realized this is likely what I'm experiencing and I'd like to hear what others' experience is.whatbare they like for you? How often do you get them, and why do you think so? What do you do to prevent/ address them?\n\n\nAnd if you just want to complain - I'm totally down for that lol. I'm all for an empathy chamber - these things are terrible!  Or am I the only nutso one that keeps running anyway and therefore needs one?? :D\n\n(FYI I don't mean dehydration headaches. Those are also terrible!!  But they also seem at least a little more comprehensible to me and I'd love to hear what other people's experiences of exertion headaches are).",
