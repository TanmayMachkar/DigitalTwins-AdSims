      "selftext": "From an email to finishers today:\n\n> we've since learned the marathon was short\u202fof the full 26.2 mile distance by 554 feet (168 meters). This was the result of unexpected race-week road construction that led to a series of misplaced turnaround cones in Grant Park (~20 mile mark). Because of this, the\u202fmarathon course will not be officially certified for this year\u2019s event.\n\nSomething felt off when I passed the mile 20 flag at about 20.10 on my watch and then the 21 flag at 20.77; this confirms it",
