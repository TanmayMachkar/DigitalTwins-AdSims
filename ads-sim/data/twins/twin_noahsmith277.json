      "selftext": "I love mixing fitness with travel, and some of the most unforgettable workouts come from running or hiking in stunning places. For me running along the Amalfi coast in Italy was surreal. The cliffside views of the Mediterranean, colourful villages and fresh sea breeze is just like a reward. What's the most beautiful route you've ever run or hiked? Share your scenic fitness adventures pleaseeee!",
