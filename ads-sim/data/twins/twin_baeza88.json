      "selftext": "I run for about 3 hours on Saturday mornings in Houston. I am a heavy sweater so take 2-500ml soft flasks filled with Gatorade Endurance with Gatorlyte and a 2L hydration reservoir filled with water. \n\nI recently bought the Hydrapak Velocity IT 2L insulated hydration reservoir. \n\nI fill my soft flasks and Hydrapak \\~75% full, freeze them overnight, and then fill the rest on the morning of my run.\n\nThis is the end of June, and yesterday my starting - ending temps were 75F - 87F, starting - ending humidity was 95%-73%, and starting - ending dew points  were 74F-78F. \n\n**The uninsulated flasks stayed cool for about 1 hour. The Hydrapak Velocity IT 2L insulated hydration reservoir stayed cool for 3 hours**. Additionally, the Hydrapak fit perfectly in my Salomon Adv Skin 12l vest.\n\nI\u2019m very happy with this purchase!",
