      "selftext": "Due to the significant role that strong calves play in long distance running, I\u2019ve consistently trained mine to improve endurance and prevent injuries. My routine mainly focuses on two legged and single legged calf raises. Most times I get a good amount of work done with those, and they have kept me in good shape thus far.\n\nNonetheless, my calves sometimes feel a little weak and stiff after an important running load. From my research, I understand it\u2019s important to train not only the calves themselves, but also to pay attention to the soleus muscle. The issue is I\u2019m not sure what to do. \n\nI\u2019d love to improve my calves for endurance training. My focus is on half marathons and an upcoming full marathon.\n\nDo you have any advice for this matter? Looking forward to your answers!",
