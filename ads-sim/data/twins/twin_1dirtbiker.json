      "selftext": "I'm training for another marathon and will be out of town for a week. I'll being doing four runs over this week, and am trying to find good trails to run. I do Google searches and have been using All Trails, but they are generally more hiking oriented, and what makes a great hiking trail doesn't always make a good running trail. Just wondering if there is a running trail app that I'm not familiar with that you guys use. Just to be clear, I'm not looking for an app to plan a run, record a run, etc. I'm looking for an app to find established trails/runs. Thanks!",
