      "selftext": "Does anyone use Runna with their Garmin? \nFor context, I have an Apple Watch Series 5, a polar H10 strap, and started HM plan with Runna. My Apple Watch is starting to shut down near the end of my outdoor runs despite me charging it fully beforehand so I think it\u2019s near retirement. Debating on making the switch to Garmin now that I\u2019ve taken to running more seriously the past couple years and training for my first HM. \nSecondly, how does Runna compare with the built-in programming that Garmin provides?
