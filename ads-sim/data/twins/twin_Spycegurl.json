      "selftext": "When I returned to running I was prescribed Stability shoes (Mizuno Wave Inspire 19's) for mild pronation in one foot. They worked fine, but since then I've been rotating 6 neutral shoes for a year without issue. I'm a forefoot runner so I wonder if stability is even a factor for me. Sometimes I do feel some ankle weakness and fatigue on long runs or if i'm tired and thought about adding in some stability into the rotation some days. I have never felt \"unstable\" so what signs do you look for for needing more stability?",
