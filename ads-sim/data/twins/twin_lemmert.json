However the article includes the video from the finish.\n\nNorwegian runner Sondre Nordstad Moen (in the pink top) crossed the finish line first but got disqualified for what he did with his arms and Suldan Hassan (in white) ended up as winner.\n\nThe Norwegian claims he didn't try to stop Suldan Hassan and he was just moving his arms to celebrate. He also says the judges are biased since they're Swedish and wants a swede to win.\n\nWhat are your opinions? Did he cheat or not? Tell me if there's anything you need translated.",
