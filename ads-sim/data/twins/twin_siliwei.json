I got so fixated on improving in something that I was finally passionate about, after being a hobby hopper all my life! I knew it\u2019d be a challenge, especially for how slow I am running, but I knew my body could recover pretty well. I got lucky with the weather for the most part and felt good all throughout my training! I had to decrease the mileage on some weeks but still ran an average of 40 miles/week, never missed a day except when sick, ran 3 20 milers and my last 20 miler, i did 5 miles, then 10 miles at goal marathon pace (9:09), followed by 5 miles. I felt good! Garmin was predicting a 3:57, and I knew garmin was pretty accurate for me based on my last race. However for like the week leading up to the race, I was so nervous! I\u2019ve never thought about myself as a nervous person before\u2026but i was getting worse quality sleep and stomachaches. First lesson learned, I shouldn\u2019t have had a pace goal for my first marathon!!\n\n\nPre-race\n\nI didn\u2019t run at all the week before the marathon, just because i was kind of feeling burnt out from running, and I wanted to be extra fresh for race day! I probably would\u2019ve ran if it wasn\u2019t for the heat wave in the twin cities right now\u2026\nI got 6 hours of sleep and woke up to the race being delayed 30 minutes. At this point I just wanted to survive and have fun, so I adjusted my goal time to 4:10 based on a heat-training calculator. Oh yeah\u2026this race was hotttt! It fluctuated a lot but the last 6 miles of the race were in the low to mid 80s. \n\nRace\n\nSo one thing about me is\u2026I\u2019ve never done well in the heat, I almost never go a day without sweating even in the winter. So I\u2019ve been getting up at like 5am for the past month to run, and so far I haven\u2019t had to run in temps over 75 and most were under 60 (all the long runs were cool too). That\u2019s just how I like it and how I will actually enjoy running, because otherwise what\u2019s the point! I guess it\u2019ll never be perfect though, because if I do a summer marathon then my training will be ideal, but then the marathon might be really hot and vice versa for a fall marathon. I guess a winter marathon would be ideal, but they don\u2019t really exist in Minnesota lol. Anyway, first mile and BAM 185 heart rate at a 9:19 pace and my garmin says i\u2019m at a -6 performance readiness and I\u2019m drenched in sweat. I also have to pee bc i\u2019ve been downing water at the start line and the lines for the portas were so long, so I only got to go like an hour before the race started. It also just feels\u2026weird to be running but I figured I was just warming up.\n9:30 pace was feeling comfortably hard, despite my HR averaging in the high 180s (max is around 202). Lesson 2, I just need to buy shokz man\u2026my beats headphones kept slipping from all the sweat which wasn\u2019t really a problem before. I took gels every 3 miles and water at basically every aid station. Around mile 16 was when it got a lot harder to hold the 9:30s so I\u2019m like ok that\u2019s way earlier than I would fatigue on my long runs but that\u2019s chill, I\u2019ll do 10:30s. There was a moderate hill at around mile 21, I was able to slowly run up it, then run the downhill that followed but after that it got sooo much harder! This was also when it got a lot hotter because we weren\u2019t getting the wind off lake superior anymore. My hamstrings probably hurt the most, my upper back and stomach too. Before, I would briefly walk through the aid stations but now I was walking through the entirety of the aid stations and at other parts too. I\u2019ve never felt that much fatigue from running it\u2019s crazy! I thought Id feel that as I was booking it to the finish line but nope\u2026those 11:30s got handsssss. This was so different from the half marathons I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve always had something left in me to do a fast last 5k and mile and sprint to the finish, but this one I had nothing left in me! I thought maybe there was some kind of mental barrier since I could sprint finish before, so I tried to pick it up at mile 25 because if I finished the last two miles in under 20 minutes I could maybe break 4:30 but nope, that wasn\u2019t happening either. At this point I was a bit confused about how my body was feeling and just because of how far off my time was going to be, even though I quit looking at my watch a while ago. All the volunteers and cheerers were amazing though it was so wholesome! I loved the live music, dancers, and some people I didn\u2019t even know looked at me and cheered my name! In any other scenario I\u2019d be creeped out but I was just so happy at that point. One thing that I was glad I did was take out my headphones once I got to duluth because it was so fun! My heart goes out to the people experiencing dehydration or other medical problems, as there were quite a few, I hope you\u2019re ok!\n\nPost-race: My hamstrings are so sore! But otherwise I\u2019m very happy I did it. I\u2019m a marathoner!! One thing I was struggling with afterwards was the slight disappointment of training at specific paces and running on average 8 hours a week+2/3 hrs of cross training (with a few 10 hour weeks too) and not even being close to my goal. Im so used to setting goals, that\u2019s how I motivate myself to do anything. But with a marathon, especially a first one, just showing up and doing the best you can is enough. I know one hard race doesn\u2019t negate all the work I did, but idk it\u2019s hard not to think about it like that. I just have to remind myself how lucky I am that I get to do this. Also comparing time trained to race time is just a recipe for bitterness and jealousy, definitely still need to work on that i\u2019ll admit it. I guess that was lesson 3 and 4?\nAnyway, thanks for reading, my whole running journey is basically on my reddit page, and to anyone who raced Grandma\u2019s today: you\u2019re all so strong fr.",
