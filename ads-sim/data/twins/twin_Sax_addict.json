      "selftext": "Any specific workout or advice with picking up pace in a race.  I've been struggling in my races to negative split.  I tend to lock into a pace early and during the race can't really 'turn it up' even though all my training suggests I can hit those paces.  In my most recent 10k, I was holding 6:35/mi pace in the first 5k but wanted to hit 6:15/6:20 in the last 5k to negative split (trying to get under sub 40).  All my training suggests I can do it (I've been doing a lot of threshold 1km repeats at 6:10-6:20 and felt fine), but was really struggling to get my legs under me for the race.  It didn't feel easy trying to hit those faster paces in the back half, and didn't really even come close.  Ended with 40:30 finish time.  HR and breathing was fine, it was just finding the stride to up the pace.  Should I just start hard and try to carry it through the whole race?  Not only this race, but in a 20k as well earlier in the year.",
