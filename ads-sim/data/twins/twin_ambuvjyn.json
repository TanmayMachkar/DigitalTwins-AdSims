      "selftext": "I\u2019m at a point in my life where every time something knocks me off balance, whether it\u2019s a bad day at work, an argument with a friend, or just that general feeling of overwhelm, my very first instinct is to head out the door and go for a run.  \nThere\u2019s something about pounding the pavement that clears my head, turns my frustration into forward motion, and reminds me that I\u2019m stronger than whatever tried to push me down.\n\nIn those first few minutes I\u2019m still tense, but with each step I shed a little bit of stress. By mile two, my mind is lighter; by mile five, I\u2019m in a whole different headspace.\n\nRunning gives me an immediate sense of control and accomplishment. I can\u2019t change what happened, but I can decide to move literally and figuratively past it.\n\nDoes anyone else use running (or another form of exercise) as a reset button?  \nHow did you discover it, and what keeps you lacing up when life gets tough?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your stories and tips!",
