      "selftext": "EDIT: I DID IT!!! Ran the Chicago marathon yesterday. For anyone who happens across this again, I did it and I cried and I am so proud of myself. \n\nI\u2019m athletic and love sports but man I hate running. So like any sane person I signed up for the Chicago marathon and got it. I\u2019ve been training for a while now since I can\u2019t run a mile without walking. I\u2019ve gotten my mileage up to ten miles so far and am on track with a marathon plan. It\u2019s just I\u2019m super slow (13 min miles since I\u2019m walking parts) and I feel like everything\u2019s going wrong. Turns out I have mild compartment syndrome in my calf and my doctor wants an mri for my other knee since he thinks there could be complications there too. I just feel so injury prone but I\u2019m doing everything right (PT, stretching, doctor). I want to do this. I want to run the marathon and I think I can I\u2019m just scared. What if I do it and don\u2019t finish? I know it happens to people and that\u2019s their story but I would be embarrassed and sad and just I\u2019m scared. Thanks for reading my rant and I guess I want to see if anyone else was scared before their first marathon and how do you get over it/what was making you scared or not scared\n\nPositive vibes only please\n\nEdit: addressing some comments - I do have the okay from PT and doctor to run it. I\u2019m not worried about what my final time would be, I just want to be able to cross that finish line!",
