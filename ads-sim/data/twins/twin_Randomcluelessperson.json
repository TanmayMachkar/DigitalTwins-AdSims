      "selftext": "I\u2019m hoping for a mature, positive discussion on this, although I know it will be controversial for some. I looked through old threads about the topic, but most discussions were based on outdated rules/policies as well as a completely different political environment.\n\nAge: 50-55\nGender: F (born male)\nPace, etc.: see below\n\nI\u2019m transgender (male to female), and although I\u2019ve been running for almost 4 decades I\u2019ve only recently run in my first 5k. It was a Pride race, so being trans was a non factor.\n\nBut now I want to enter more races, and I don\u2019t want to stir the pot or cause any controversy. Most runners I know are very inclusive and welcoming, but I know there are exceptions. Entering a race as a \u201cman\u201d when I\u2019m absolutely not would be traumatic enough that I would likely not run at all. So, do I enter as my correct gender and hope it doesn\u2019t become a big deal? Do I contact the race organizers each time? (a very uncomfortable conversation when I just want to run) Some considerations:\n\n-I do not \u201cpass\u201d very well at this point. If someone looks at me closely they can generally tell I\u2019m trans.\n\n-I have been transitioning for 2.5 years. My hormones have been in the correct range for a significant time, and my testosterone levels are actually lower than cisgender women.\n\n-I am not an elite runner by any stretch. My 10k PR is ~58 minutes and my 5k just under 27. The one half marathon I ran (by myself, not in a race) was over 3 hours.\n\n-I won\u2019t be entering any races where I might win any monetary or other tangible awards, so I wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctaking\u201d anything from cisgender runners.\n\nI\u2019m open to hearing conflicting opinions, but hopefully this can be civil.",
