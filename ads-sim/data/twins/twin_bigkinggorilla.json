      "selftext": "I think for newer runners, myself included, goals move in pretty big steps. \n\nE.g., Break 90 in the 10k is followed by break 80, is followed by break 70, not break 88 then break 87.\n\nI think this makes sense, there\u2019s a lot of easy progress to be made and unless you\u2019re racing every month there\u2019s no reason to stress over super marginal improvements.\n\nBut when did you start to focus on those marginal or incremental gains? And what do you think caused that change?\n\n\n\n\n",
