      "selftext": "I (26f) am just getting into running, and I'm looking for budget friendly undergarment/compression type pants that I can wear under track shorts (specifically white ones). They'd be used for cold runs, and also in the summer for sun protection. I'm getting a bit frustrated because it seems like they make compression \"under\" pants for men, but all I can find for women are thicker, more stylish compression leggings that are made to be worn by themselves. Any suggestions will help, thanks!",
