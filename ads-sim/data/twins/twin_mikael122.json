      "selftext": "Did not know if this was the correct sub but, there are many endurance athletes so I figured I might get some insight.\n\nI constantly see influencers like Peter Attia recommend at least 4 hours of zone 2 cardio with 1-2 days of high intensity training that will help with VO2 MAX etc. Where do those recs come from? what is the science/research?   \n  \nWith regard to resistance training there is science.  You want a minimum amount of training (reps/sets) and to hit the muscle with enough intensity because of this it is best to split the volume throughout the week. There is rhyme and reason.   \n  \nBut what about optimizing the cardiovascular system? Where do they get the 4 hours of zone 2 cardio with 1-2 days of high intensity training?\n\nThank you",
