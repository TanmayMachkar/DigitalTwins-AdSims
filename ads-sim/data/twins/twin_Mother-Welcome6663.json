      "selftext": "Looking for recommendations for running tights/leggings that won't roll down for my first half marathon. What are your favorites? I've been much happier with shorts but it will be chilly. Debating whether it's worth it,  because I'd rather be cold than tugging at my pants the whole time! I'm hoping for pockets to keep one or two Stinger waffles. I've struggled with fanny packs and water backpacks.  TIA!! ",
