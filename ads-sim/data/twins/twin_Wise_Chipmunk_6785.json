      "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm preparing to run my first 21km half-marathon this September. I've heard that energy gels like GU can be really helpful during the race, but I have gastritis, so I'm concerned they might upset my stomach. I noticed some gels contain caffeine, which could potentially worsen my symptoms.\n\nDoes anyone know of stomach-friendly alternatives or specific gel brands without caffeine or irritating ingredients? Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",
