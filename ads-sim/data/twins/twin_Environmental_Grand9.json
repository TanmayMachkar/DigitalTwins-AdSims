      "selftext": "Hey fellow runners!\n\nI've got a bit of a recurring travel headache I wanted to ask about, hoping some of you have cracked the code.\n\nI absolutely LOVE running when I travel. It's genuinely my favourite way to explore a new city\n\nBut... actually\u00a0finding\u00a0a good route can be a real pain sometimes\n\nMy usual process is a bit clunky:\n\n* **Strava Heatmaps:**\u00a0Great for seeing where\u00a0other\u00a0people run, but doesn't easily give me a specific\u00a0route\u00a0of a specific distance, especially a loop starting and ending at my random Airbnb.\n* **Google Maps/Street View:**\u00a0So much guesswork. Is this road actually runnable? Is it safe? Is it going to be fumes-ville? Takes ages.\n* **Asking the Hotel:**\u00a0Sometimes helpful, sometimes they look at me like I'm mad for wanting to run 10k before breakfast and suggest a lap around the block.\n\nWhat I\u00a0really\u00a0struggle with is getting a reliable loop of a specific distance (say, exactly 10k, or maybe a longer 20k for a weekend trip) that starts and finishes right back at my accommodation. I hate ending up miles away and having to navigate back tired, or doing weird out-and-backs just to hit my target mileage.\n\nI feel like this must be a common problem for runners who travel frequently. How do you all handle it? Am I missing some obvious tool or trick? Or are you secretly using some magic AI route-generating app I need to know about?!\n\nWould love to hear your strategies and any app recommendations you have!\n\nThanks in advance! Happy running!",
