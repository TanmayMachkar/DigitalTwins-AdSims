      "selftext": "I've searched the sub and don't see anything recent on this topic, so I hope this post is okay.\n\nI'm aware that the Shokz Openrun pro is the best pure running earphones but I need something that's a bit more all round. Details below.\n\nBeen using the Jabra elite active 75 for the last 3.5 years but the right side earbud no longer produces sound. These earbuds were generally awesome, except for massively amplified wind noise on hearthrough mode. I looked at the latest model (elite active 8) and while it looks great, I want to know what else is out there.\n\nI travel a lot, so something that's comfortable on short flights with ANC is preferred. Especially if I can also use it for virtual meetings and calls. Small form factor case makes it convenient in laptop bag, rather than my full size headset.\n\nMy gym is super loud, so open profile or bone conduction headphones are a problem since I often can't hear my own music over gym noise\n\nI'd like hearthrough/environment sounds so that I can hear cars when running on the roads, but without the massively amplified wind noise.\n\nETA: I don't have an iPhone",
