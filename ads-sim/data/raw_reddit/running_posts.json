    "title": "Tis the Season! Time for the Annual cold / cool / winter weather running and gear thread",
    "selftext": "Now that Winter is quickly approaching (in the Northern Hemisphere, at least), it seems we are are getting more winter/cold weather posts which means it is time for the annual Winter Megathread.\n\n[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather#wiki_winter.2Fcold) the link for the cold weather info in our wiki.  I will add this post to that at a later date.  If you happen to be in the Southern Hemisphere and entering the season of the big fiery death ball in the sky, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/weather/) the link to the \"Running in the Heat\" section of the wiki .\n\n**Why should I run in the winter?**\n\n* Winter running makes you strong!\n\n* That person you really want to beat next year is out there training right now\n\n* Spring weather feels so much better when you\u2019ve been training through the winter\n\n\n**Clothing**\n\nYou\u2019re going to want materials that will keep you warm even when damp or wet. Think wool, fleece, and wicking synthetics. You\u2019ll also want things to be breathable so you don\u2019t get super sweaty (and even colder).  Layer up so you can adjust during your run.\n\nTrapped air is what keeps you warm and cozy in the winter. If your shoes are really tight with a couple pairs of socks on, or your gloves/mittens are too tight, you may have less trapped air and impair circulation, which will make you cold.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of what works well for some in calm, dry conditions. Keep in mind wind or precipitation will make things colder, and that it\u2019s always better to have an extra layer than to make do without.  This can also vary widely between people and how comfortable you want to be.  Use the table as a guide to layering suggestions factoring in how fast/slow you are running (for generating body heat) as well as how hot/cool natured you normally are.\n\n**Temp Range**|**Upper**|**Lower**|**Socks**|**Hands**|**Head**\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n30 to 40F (-1 to 5C)|Long-sleeve (LS) shirt|Shorts or light pants|regular socks|Light gloves|headband\n20 to 30F (-6 to -1C)|LS shirt + baselayer|Regular tights|1x midweight wool|Light gloves|headband\n10 to 20F (-12 to -6C)|LS Baselayer + wind vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs|2x midweight wool|Mittens|Hat + light gator\n0 to 10F (-18 to -12C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket or vest|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens|heavy hat, fleece balaclava, eye protection\n<0 F (<-18 C)|LS Baselayer + Fleece jacket + Wind jacket|Thermal tights + windbriefs + leggings|2x heavier wool socks|Heavy mittens w/ gloves underneath|heavy hat x2, fleece balaclava, eye protection (glasses or goggles, if windy)\n\nHere are some useful links to some guides that can help you choose appropriate amount of clothing:\n\n[Fahrenheit Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/GKwoDUQ.jpg)\n\n[Celsius Pictorial Guide](https://i.imgur.com/KKbJgwl.jpg)\n\n[Dress My Run Website - Quick tool to show what to wear based on where you live and weather](http://dressmyrun.com/)\n\n* Click on \"Settings\" in the bottom right hand corner to adjust your personal temperature preference (warmer or cooler)\n\n**Footwear**\n\nRoad shoes are fine most of the time, unless you're running somewhere that consistently has snow or ice-covered sidewalks. If you have good socks, your feet should stay warm even if damp from melting snow. Think more carefully about your footwear if there\u2019s snow or ice on the ground.\nOn fresh snow or packed, but still soft snow, trail shoes (something with a low to moderate lug) work very well.  [Turning an old pair of road shoes into Screw Shoes](https://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/running-shoe-screws) is an excellent idea for ice, thawed and refrozen snow, and heavily packed snow conditions \u2013 the screws do a great job providing a bit of extra traction.\n\nYou can also look into traction devices (like Yaktrax) when icy.\n\nWhen running, direction changes and stopping are the most likely times to slip and fall on snow or ice. Slow down and be cautious around corners and street crossings. As you run, make sure you\u2019re landing with your feet underneath your center of mass \u2013 even if you do have a slippery step, keep your feet moving, and you can usually recover and avoid a fall.\n\n**Safety**\n\nIf you work during the day, chances are your morning or evening run will be dark. Get yourself a good headlamp (to see and be seen), and wear a reflective vest over your other clothing. Know that motorists may be less likely to expect you to be out running when it\u2019s 15 degrees and snowing.\n\nIf it's really cold, make adjustments or plans to ensure you can stay safe during your run even if you turn an ankle or something else happens where you can't keep running to stay warm. Plan your route along safe warm zones (friend's house, grocery stores, etc.), and/or carry your cell phone (close to your body, so your battery doesn't die). If you for some reason can't run, you will quickly get very chilled.  [Here's](https://www.weather.gov/bou/windchill) a Windchill Safety chart from the National Weather Service to help determine when things might be too dangerous to run or if you do, to take extra safety precautions.\n\nStart your runs into the wind - this will be the coldest part - so that your finish your runs with a warmer tailwind. This can make a big difference - if you get sweaty during your run, and turn into a stiff breeze to finish, you're likely to get chilled as you're heading home.\n\nHere's a good post on [Running in snow tips..?](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/zj8zhw/running_in_snow_tips/)\n\n\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nEven when it\u2019s cold out, you\u2019ll want to be sure you\u2019re hydrated before and during long runs. You\u2019re probably sweating more than you might think, it will evaporate quickly in cold dry air. Have a method to keep fluids from freezing when it\u2019s cold out, either by keeping fluids under a layer of clothing (vest or hydration pack), planning a route around accessible water, or figuring out a way to keep your handheld from freezing up.\n\nGels and other foods can freeze too \u2013 tuck these items into a glove or mitten a few minutes before you want to eat, to thaw them out and warm them up.\n\n###**The comments below will be divided into some broad categories to try and keep things organized.

Reading about it, it looks like it's on hard sand / done near the water.\n\nSpecifically wondering about:\n\n* Road shoes versus trail shoes?\n* Any other gear recommendations from people who've done beach races before? (e.g. certain type of socks to deal with the sand and potential water from waves?) And in that level of heat/humidity as well, given it's along the beach - any thoughts on split shorts vs half-tights, and tank top vs shirtless?\n* Pacing - my HM PB is 1:31 so not sure how I should adjust my pace. Not looking to PB but keen to give it a decent crack.\n* And open to any other tips\n\nMy city isn't really built for beach running, so the earliest I can realistically do a test beach run is the day before the race when I fly up.",

Meant as a rust-buster and gauge of where my legs are at, things went way better than expected and left me with lots to reflect on as I begin to map out the next year of fitness.\n\n**Training**\n\nI went into this race with fairly minimal expectations, in part because I haven\u2019t done any run-specific training since the spring. I was physically and mentally wiped after the Ottawa Half-Marathon in May and needed a break from intense running work. I pivoted to cycling for most of the summer, with running mainly serving as cross-training \u2013 easy runs only (with the occasional long easy run thrown in). From May to September, my weekly volume was anywhere from 6km to 25km \u2013 all of it easy \u2013 with bike volume ranging from 140km/week to 280km/week. I did one quality session last weekend (6x1km threshold) to get the legs used to fast running again.\n\n**The Course**\n\nCanada Army Run starts at the usual Ottawa race starting blocks (on Laurier between City Hall and Confederation Park) and ends at the National War Memorial at the intersection of Elgin and Wellington about a block east of Parliament. I last ran the Army Run in 2022 (a then-PB of 46:4x) and this year\u2019s course was broadly similar: the [10k course](https://www.racepoint.ca/maps/armyrun.html) goes out-and-back on Wellington, then down Sussex Dr. before circling back at the grounds of Rideau Hall and heading back downtown. It\u2019s similar to the back half of this past spring\u2019s Half course. On Sunday, the first 5k were a net downhill and the back 5k a net uphill.\n\nGiven the lack of run-specific training since May, this was a tough one to figure out how to pace. My bike legs felt *really* good through the summer, but I was somewhat unsure of how that would translate to running. Based on the 1km threshold repeats a week ago, I settled on a plan to go out at 4:33-4:35/km and then make pacing decisions in the back half based on how the legs felt. On Saturday, I decided to be a little bolder: stick with the 45:00 pacers until I got dropped, then go from there. I went in with little to no pressure, but with an informal yardstick that I\u2019d be pleased with anything faster than 45:30.\n\n**Race**\n\nWoke up at 6am, ate pre-race breakfast, and took the LRT to my office (which is just across from the start area) to change and drop my bag at my desk. The 5k was running past me as I exited the building shortly after 8. Did around 3km of warmup with a few race pace pickups, then found my way to the first race corral with the 45min pacers. The weather was perfect: +8 at the startline with enough of a breeze to cool you off, but not enough to feel like you were fighting crosswinds.\n\nThings were delayed a few minutes from the planned 8:45 start, but the starting howitzer (not a typo) went off for the first corral a little before 8:50. We got up to speed quickly and set to work with a pace group of around 30 runners. The opening km of the 5k and 10k are always a little frantic as folks try to escape crowding, and we split it a bit faster than intended (4:17). Got into a really good rhythm in the section up and down Wellington, then kept it going through the descent towards the Chateau Laurier and the National Gallery on Sussex (4:27/4:25/4:21/4:29 for the next 4k). Things were feeling solid at the halfway split (22:10) \u2013 way better than I\u2019d expected. We slowed a little in the false flats through and around the Rideau Hall grounds (4:30/4:26) and back onto Sussex to head to the finishing stretch (4:29). The road turned north to head back to downtown, and we found ourselves running smack into a headwind. The group had been steadily whittling down since Rideau Hall; when we hit the headwind, it quickly disintegrated.\n\nIn past 10k races, I\u2019ve had a bad habit of cracking in the penultimate km; even when I\u2019ve been able to dial it back in for the final km, it\u2019s reliably been my slowest split \u2013 by a healthy margin - in the last three 10ks I\u2019ve run. Between the late race fatigue, the false flat, and the headwind, I was rapidly running out of matches and could see runners dropping from the group around me. I kept waiting for the crack to happen, and\u2026it didn\u2019t. Split that km 4:32 \u2013 the slowest of the race so far, but not aggressively so.\n\nThe final boss of this race is a brute: From Sussex, the race turns back onto Wellington and ascends a 250m kicker to the finish at the war memorial. It\u2019s a 5% gradient from the turn until about 10m before the finish line. I\u2019ve done the Army Run twice before this one (one 5k and one 10k) and have watched countless runners completely fall apart on that finishing hill. The pacer nearest me called out \u201cget ready to hurt!\u201d as we made the turn, and hurt it did. A productive summer of getting my legs ripped off on grouprides came in handy: if there\u2019s one thing I know how to do, it\u2019s smash out a 45-second effort deep into the red after a long period at threshold. I very nearly puked with about 40m to go but managed to keep it together and cross the line. Chip clocked in at 44:3x: my third sub-45, my second-fastest 10k ever, and only 12s short of my PB.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI was *vibrating* as I walked through the finishing area to grab my medal, electrolytes, and post-race snack. If you\u2019d asked me pre-race what a \u201cgreat race\u201d would look like, I\u2019d have said somewhere in the 45:00-45:15 range. I\u2019d planned to stay with the 45min pacer until they dropped me; instead, I crossed the line one second ahead of them. After spending the summer not focused on running, having mid-44 in the legs was not on my radar *at all*. It was also the smoothest race I\u2019ve ever run: no ninth km blowup, no feed zone mishaps, no aggressively positive splits (22:10 and 22:2x). The thought that kept coming into my head the rest of the day was \u201coh, so that\u2019s what it feels like when you finally put it all together\u201d. I\u2019m still riding the post-race high.\n\nIt also has me thinking about the future and perhaps needing to adjust some of my near-term running goals. The tentative plan for 2026 is to prioritize the 10k distance for the spring (and use that block to test whether I have the durability to survive a plan that peaks in the 60-70km/week range) before taking another swing at 1:40 at the Toronto Waterfront Half in the fall. A week ago, I\u2019d planned to set sub-44 as a 10k goal for the spring, but if I\u2019m at the point where I can knock out a mid-44 on low + easy running volume and bike training alone, I think I need to reassess what an ambitious-yet-realistic goal looks like. I also need to reflect on how I mentally approach goal races: I felt *way* less stressed going into this race, and I think the lack of internal pressure helped me run a smoother, better, faster race.\n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.\n\n\u00a0",

    "title": "Broke runners rejoice : How to not feel like shit + tips and tricks",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone!  \n  \nFirst off, thank you for clicking on this post. Reddit can feel like a whirlwind of endless content, so the fact that you're here means a lot!\n\nI\u2019m 21, a full-time student, and I started running back in April. Since then, I\u2019ve completed two half marathons and a 10K, and I\u2019ve loved every second of it. I know that\u2019s not your average beginner\u2019s first six months, but I came into running with a solid fitness base from hiking, skiing (I\u2019m a ski instructor), and rock climbing. Running felt like a natural extension and best of all, it was free. As such, it was the only sport I could afford.\n\nThis spring, summer, and fall, my job\u2019s run club covered the entry fees for three local races, which made it possible for me to participate. Without that support, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. So yeah, I\u2019m broke, but that\u2019s student life, and I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019ll have \u201cadult money\u201d one day.\n\nNow I\u2019m looking ahead: I want to run my first full marathon next summer. The same run club will cover the entry fee for one marathon (the only one in my city), and I want to take that opportunity. But I\u2019ve got questions and I\u2019d love your advice.\n\nThe short form : Running on a budget, how do you do it?\n\nThe long one : \n\n* Have any of you trained for and run marathons without the fancy gear such as carbon-plated shoes, Garmin watches and custom coaching plans?\n* What are your go-to strategies for keeping this sport affordable?\n* How did you structure your training when money was tight? How do you create your training plan if you are new to the sport and can't pay for a coach or expensive subscription?\n* What gear is truly essential, and what can you skip or DIY?\n* Can you run a marathon while keeping cost low?\n\n**Beyond these questions I also want to let this be a thread for broke runners.** Whether you\u2019re a student like me, working adult, or retiree, if you love this sport but don\u2019t have deep pockets, I hope this post helps you feel seen and supported. Let\u2019s share tips, hacks, and encouragement for making running accessible to everyone.\n\nSpeaking for myself, at my last race, I was the runner with the oldest shoes in the people around me, a mismatched outfit that looked thrown together 2 minutes before the race (I picked it very carefully...), and a five-year-old Apple Watch that misreads distance and pace almost every time. I only started using gels about a month before the race, trying to get used to them just in time to chase a personal best. (They\u2019re basically miracle fuel but wow, they\u2019re expensive.\n\nI\u2019ll be real : I felt like shit. At my last race, I looked around and just felt completely out of place. Everyone seemed dialed in: sleek gear, matching outfits, perfect watches, confident smiles. And there I was with beat-up shoes (I have plans to buy a new pair, don't worry), a glitchy old Apple Watch, a last-minute attempt at figuring out gels, hoping I wouldn\u2019t crash halfway through. One runner in the same corral/behind the same official race pacer as me even told me to get new shoes lmao (that hurt, even if I don't think it was meant in a bad way!)\n\nI ran hard. I showed up. And yeah, I\u2019m proud of that. But it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that I didn't belong in that race\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because I need to feel seen. If you\u2019ve been there, if you\u2019ve run through that same problem, I\u2019d love to hear your story. I think it might help me fall back in love with this sport. Or at least remind me why I started.\n\nThanks again for reading. I appreciate you all!\n\nEDIT : Some people are saying my post is AI. To be transparent I used it to clean up because English isn\u2019t my first language and it\u2019s hard to write in it. The questions and thoughts are still real !",

It is also hilly; the first 3K or so is all uphill, following which it is undulating but includes another steep climb in the village of Oliver\u2019s Battery, the segment for which on Strava is named \u201cDrained battery.\u201d\n\nI arrived at the race village around 1 hour before the 9:00am start time; there were people around but it was strangely quiet. There had been an incident on the motorway, which was therefore closed, and the race was delayed by at least 30 minutes, in part because of delayed runners but also because key traffic marshals were stuck in the traffic and without their presence the race could not go ahead. There were even whispers that the race might be cancelled; road closures are difficult to manage at the best of times, everything has to be pre-approved by the authorities and if the race missed its time window it might have to be abandoned.\n\nThe weather was perfect, everything was set up, and runners milled around feeling a bit glum. It is odd to prepare oneself for a race, have an early breakfast and warm-up run, and then \u2026 nothing. I began to feel hungry; the plan was to do the race and have a second breakfast afterwards, but I did not want to eat again before running. \n\nAfter 45 minutes or so there was some good news. The race would go ahead, the start time would be sometime after 10:00am. I had a chat with the two 1:40 pacers; they said they would try to keep an even pace despite the hills. I would therefore fall behind initially but hoped to catch up and overtake them later.\n\nNutrition? I tend to take a half marathon in my stride as far as possible. Early breakfast. One gel before the start and then nothing, I did not stop at the water stations.\n### Race\nAt 10:15 the race began. I started just behind the 1:40 pacers and as predicted, they disappeared ahead as I laboured up the first hills. The 1:45 pacers passed me as well. Nevertheless I felt pretty good; one redeeming feature of this course is that the starting climb is the worst and there are some nice steady downhills to come. We reached the junction with Kilham Lane on the left and the famous Clarendon Way on the right, the road levels out, and I began to speed up. You need to average 7:38/mile pace for sub-1:40; mile 3 I did in 7:16, mile 4 in 7:00 and mile 5 in 6:39 (yes it is downhill!). \n\nI thanked the 1:40 pacers as I passed them and they told me that all I needed to do was to stay in front. Well I knew that; but \u201cdrained battery\u201d was still to come.\n\nYou reach a charming village called Hursley with is the far point of the race. Next comes a relatively gentle climb up a narrow country lane, back to Oliver\u2019s Battery which is on the outskirts of Winchester. Grind up the last major hill, and then the last 4.5 miles are easy. My time on the dreaded segment was 5:22, beating last year\u2019s 5:39, and I was pretty sure then that I would achieve sub-1:40.\n\nThe last 4 miles have a few twists. There is an underpass where you actually have to go down steps; I tend to be cautious here for fear of falling over! Then there is a steepish descent, too steep for an ideal pace, followed by a flattish three miles or so to the finish. I tried to keep up the pace, foolishly hoping that I might win my age category. Back into the city centre, under the historic Kingsgate arch, around a few corners, then the sprint to the finish, rudely overtaken in the last stretch by a runner perhaps half my age!\n### Post-race\n1:37:17 and an improvement of over 3 minutes from last year, but also a bit of an anti-climax. I realised that the not-very-generous race organisers had 10 year age categories so I had no chance of winning (I was 4th out of 24), and also discovered that I had apparently failed to order a t-shirt. \n\nOn the plus side, Starbucks were offering a free coffee to all finishers and I wandered along to collect my tall Americano which turned out to be more tasty than expected, possibly improved by post-race thirst. It was now lunchtime and too late for a second breakfast so I wandered home instead, thanking the excellent marshals en route; a tough day for them since they had been out longer than expected and remained super cheerful and encouraging. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I had not run more than maybe 1.5 miles since I graduated college. I decided I needed to get healthy and began running and taking my diet more seriously. I was briefly interrupted due to having my tonsils removed but kept going after. \n\nMy more structured training began 26 weeks before the race. I used Runna as I do well with structured training plans like that. I know it isn\u2019t the best training plan or generator but I really felt myself progressing each week.\n\nThen came the major interruption to training. My wife and I welcomed our twins 6 weeks early and had a 2 week NICU stay. On top of that we faced some major colic and digestive issues once we finally got them home. I was not able to run for almost 10 weeks straight. \n\nAround 10 weeks before the race I finally got back to being able to run. I restarted my plan and prayed for the best. It was a rough 10 weeks but we made it. All in all, I lost around 45 pounds through training. 65 over all since I started running. \n\n### Pre-race\nPre-Race was pretty much the same as pre long run. Toast with some peanut butter(I usually have jelly.), a granola bar and some electrolytes. It was a rainy morning but luckily was down to a drizzle by the time I was leaving. \n\n### Race\nThe course was a double out and back. That made it a little bit hard to estimate other runners as I wasn\u2019t sure if they were shooting for a 10K or half. I felt decent to start despite getting some lack luster sleep. \n\nThe first time out was pretty good. There were some really slick spots from the rain. Both myself and some other runners almost fell a few times. By the time I was heading back at around 5 miles the humidity was getting to me. I was sweating much harder than normal. \n\nBetween miles 9 and 10 I really hit a wall. I had to stop and walk for a second for the first time. I was starting to get pretty achey and felt like my right leg was cramping. As I got to about 1.5 miles left my right calf was really cramping. Walks became more common. As soon as I realized I wouldn\u2019t hit sub 2 hours I was pretty bummed but I knew I could still hit a PR. \n\nThe twins greeted me at the finish line which really helped!\n\n### Post-race\nMy legs were toasted. I cramped hard as hell as I waited to grab my medal and see where I placed in my age group. I crushed some chocolate milk they had.\n\nNow I\u2019m gonna crush a pint of Ben and Jerry\u2019s tonight. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "I'm getting into running and I thought HR training might be a good way to start without overdoing it. There are so many HR equations/models out there that I'm getting a bit overwhelmed and since Google sucks these days, I figure my best bet would be to ask for input here.\n\nThe sticking point for me is that my resting heart rate (RHR) is kinda low (\\~48-55bpm) despite being a couch potato for years. Cardiologist said its prolly just high vagal tone and nothing to worry about impacting exercise. But since my RHR is so low, I feel like I need to pick an HR calculation that accounts for it because low RHR may violate the assumptions of the more simplistic HR training calculations.\n\nI'd like to ask for some suggestions on how to pick a training strategy from there. I'm the type of person that just needs to pick a prescription/schedule and once it's set, I'll run with it (heh heh). I just want something that isn't wildly off the general range i need to find myself in. Even just linking some resources would be helpful cause again, Google sucks these days. Or telling me that I'm over thinking this and that I should just shoot from the hip and pick one would also be helpful.\n\nSorry if this is a redundant question. I tried poking around your sub but didn't find anything addressing HR training for someone who is both a couch potato and has low RHR (although I def could have missed something). Any links to previous relevant posts also very much welcome.\n\nUpdate for anyone bothering to check:\n\nI decided to table HR for now like many here have suggested. Maybe a couple months from now I'll revisit the specific HR recommendations I've seen here. I've been sticking to a 30 min run 3x this week which is 10 min up from the 20 min runs i was doing in prior weeks. They haven't been that bad actually so next week I'll set 3x 40 min runs and then maybe after that I'll do the 2x 30min and 1 x 1hr depending on how i feel. I'm gonna have to plan around activities if they get any longer lol.\n\nEven though i wasn't going to try to run faster, i've been playing around with posture and step length and i found that if i tighten my core and take longer steps, i can go way faster without really expending any more energy (y'all probably already know that). Also, I really like finishing a run at a cruising pace so i've been running incrementally faster each minute to a full sprint in the final 6 min just cause i like the feeling of finishing a run out-of-breath. I feel like that scratches the speed itch I'm still feeling without overdoing it and still making sure i get enough time/distance in.",

After three attempts at running 5k at my race pace, I finally managed to get under 25 min again, but had to walk several times to recover during the run, which didn't happen in my last parkruns. I tried my first 'long' run today, but I really struggled to find a conversational pace when going uphill and had to walk to stop gasping for air. I only did 7k in 46 min, probably less than 6k of actual running, with an elevation gain of 183 m, and I feel more tired than I should after an easy long run. \n\nThere are a lot of threads here about the optimal pace for a long run, which usually recommend going 1-1:30 min/mile slower than racing pace, but I haven't found much advice about hilly terrain, especially for inexperienced runners. So my question is: does a conversational pace even exist when running such steep roads as a beginner/intermediate? Should I just drive somewhere flatter to run, or should I stick to the hills and try to find a slower, comfortable pace?",

    "selftext": "I do most of my running in 2 places: South Florida and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The way I\u2019m treated as a runner on the roads in these places is wildly different, and was wondering what it\u2019s like in other areas.\n\nFlorida: Even at a crosswalk, cars don\u2019t yield. People with dogs on leashes do not shorten the leash or move so they aren\u2019t taking up the entire sidewalk and I\u2019ve been clotheslined more than once. Dogs off leashes can\u2019t be trusted not to chase you. People walking or standing around chatting, even when they see you coming, do not shift over to let you pass. Cars don\u2019t give you any extra room even if the other lane is empty. Cyclists are hit or miss. Some yield to you, some force you to pull a Homer Simpson in the bushes kind of move to avoid being hit. Other runners wave or nod maybe 1/4 of the time. In short, every person for him or herself. And I hate it.\n\nMassachusetts: Entirely different story. People in cars stop to let me cross even if there isn\u2019t a crosswalk. The cars wait for the other lane to open up so they can give me more room. So much more awareness and consideration to others sharing the road, sidewalk, or trail. Rules generally followed about which side to bike or walk on, and cyclists yield to runners. Eye contact when we pass and some kind of acknowledgement.\n\nI often say we have a culture problem here in Florida, and it transfers into so many aspects of life. It\u2019s very me, not we.\n\nIt\u2019s just such a drastic difference. So I\u2019m curious what it\u2019s like in other states and countries.",

Never really liked any kind of sport. But like a lot of people approaching the wrong side of 40, I needed to lose weight so I started jogging. No plan, no programme, had flunked out of Couch to 5K a few times so I just said I'd run to the next lamp post, the next Pokestop, whatever. Gradually, it became easier to run for a whole song, then a few songs and so on. It got to where I needed to buy proper trainers, proper shorts, something to hold my phone, that kind of thing. Wasn't breaking any land speed records but I was able to do 5-6 km at a time a few times a week. For a few years now, an Autism charity in Ireland has had a 5k run event. It's advertised as accessible and for all ages, abilities and so on but I'd never had any interested in going. This year, as I was starting to get into running, I said I'd sign up. I'm autistic so I figured it would be nice to raise some money for the charity and give something back to my community.\n\n\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nMy wife was working and I didn't really have any friends who were interested in coming along with me, so off I went on the day on my own. The race was due to start at 12 but the event started at 11, so I said I'd get there for 10:30 to beat traffic and crowds. I figured I could sit in the grass and read my book or just relax and wait for the event to start. The first thing I noticed was how busy it was already. Everyone had my idea, get there early. There was plenty of space but it was already kinda hectic. Next thing was: no bag drop. I had just a change of shirt and some food but there was nowhere to put it, which I thought was a bit of an oversight. I think I was quite unique, almost everyone there had someone with them that was waiting around the finish zone that was holding their stuff. It was definitely more of a family fun day than a race event. Waited around until 11:40 or so and then they kinda called everyone over to do some kind of warm-up and have a little talk about it. They say to not change anything on a race day and I guess that really applies to Marathoners but for 5k, it's probably less important. Still, the race was starting way later than I'm used to (I usually run before work around 7am) and so that was a bit different for \"fuelling\". The other thing was that I never really do a warm up. I stretch my legs a little and walk to my starting point and then run a little slower than my pace until I feel warmed up. This warm up was pretty full on, something that actually tired me out quite a bit ha ha.\n\n\n\n\\### Race\n\nEventually, we all got warmed up and lined up and here we go. As the event was accessible, there was plenty of non-runners, walkers, kids on bikes or scooters, people with dogs, everything you could imagine. There was no instructions from the organisers for people to line-up by category or ability or anything (part of the event is the idea of giving everyone the same chance in life, so it all feeds into that). This meant a solid kilometre of having to dodge around people, running on grass and whatever way I could to get around them. Again, as someone who only runs on my own at unsociably early hours, this was a new experience and I didn't care for it. It also meant I went out waaay too fast and had to really reel it back in. I guess some form of adrenaline or excitement kicked in. I eventually found my rhythm, even settling in with some people around the same pace as me (I assumed). One group would walk for half a k or so and then run for half a k. When they walked, they blocked the whole path and I had to run around them to get past. When they ran, they would overtake me comfortably and then spread out in front of me again when they slowed down to walk. That annoyed me a little but at one point I overtook them and they never came past me again, so I guess I won.\n\n\n\nAnother thing was how hot it was. I know other people run in hot weather but I am not used to it. Usually by the time I finish my run, it's way before the hottest part of the day. It was 22c by the time we got going, unbearably hot for me when I'm not running, never mind when I'm trying to do a 5km. I could really feel myself flagging for the last 2km and they were below my pace. Luckily, my first 3 were fast enough that I was still able to finish under 40 minutes. I don't know if this is normal for an event like this, but the run tracker I use was a little off, not showing 3k until I was about a minute after the marker. On the final stretch, the markers said 500 m to go but my tracker was saying 700 meters. Then, right at the finish line it synched up to 5km and I was so tired I didn't know what had happened (except that I had finished and hit my target). Not sure if that's normal. They also told me the course was flat but my Runkeeper told me I'd had the 3rd most elevation change of any run I'd ever done, so something's not right there ha ha\n\n\n\nSomething that was a little fun was right at the finish line, two little kids had their hands out to give 5 to the runners but no-one running past was paying them attention (at least from when I spotted them). So as I ran past, I somehow mustered the strength to stoop down and slap their palms and they seemed delighted. I have seen people do this at race events so I was glad I was able to do it, as silly as that sounds.\n\n\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nFinished the race and got my medal. Felt good. Found a patch of grass and sat down to take a selfie and show off my medal, message my wife and friends and just catch my breath. The post race zone had a water station, so I went over and had some water. Everything else was really busy (coffee place, ice cream van and a sandwich place) and I was pretty exhausted and didn't fancy standing around for much longer, so I headed off. If I was to do this again, I'd make sure I had a few people with me, even if they're not running, because it's more of a family event. I'd also probably get a bit closer to the front for the start to avoid people pushing buggies and with dogs on leads. Speaking of pushing buggies, a guy ran the whole race in front of me pushing his kid in some kind of sports buggy and when I got to the finish line, they were giving the baby a medal. I didn't see if they awarded any dogs a medal. A running club near where my dad lives is doing a 5k for the same charity in November. It's not a family friendly event so I might sign up for that to see what that kind of race is like.\n\n\n\nOverall, my first ever running event, I didn't have a bad time but I like running solo for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

But I had been running consistently since 2023, had two [half marathons](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1d2i8ub/calgary_half_marathon_a_flawless_training_block_a/) under my belt, and had just wrapped up a [10K training block](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1l7ztxx/10k_time_trial_chasing_a_stretch_goal/) that ended with a result I was really happy with. So I figured I\u2019d keep the momentum going and aim for something bigger. That \"something\" turned out to be the Edmonton Marathon.\n\nInitially, I set my sights on a sub-4:00 finish, based on my VDOT-predicted time. But I quickly revised that to something more modest: just finishing, ideally around 6:00 min/km. And I was totally fine with revising _that_ upwards if things went south [_Narrator: Oh boy, and did things go south!_]\n\n### Training\nFor training, I made what I now see as my biggest mistake: I relied on Garmin\u2019s _Daily Suggested Workouts_. The mileage was consistently low; even lower than Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Plan. I was running five days a week, but my weekly totals hovered around 40\u201345 km. My longest run, in mid-July, topped out at just 17 km (1:48:00).\n\nWith just four weeks to go before race day, I realized I had plateaued far short of where I needed to be. At that point, I asked ChatGPT to sketch out a plan for me. It did; and that meant bumping up both weekly mileage and long run distance very quickly. I ran 55 km the first week, with a 25 km long run. The following week, I hit 60 km, including a 28 km long run. On both long runs, I ran the final 5 km at my target pace.\n\nI knew it was risky to ramp both weekly mileage and long run distance so quickly, but I went in prepared to pull the plug if anything felt off. Miraculously, I made it through injury-free, probably thanks to the intensity of my 10K training block and the base building I did before then. \n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Family and work commitments meant I was up at 4:30 am most mornings to run, before heading straight into a full day. Sleep was poor; often under six hours a night plus a 20-minute afternoon nap.\n\nA month before the race, my wife finally put her foot down and insisted I start going to bed by 10:00 pm. That one change made a huge difference. Within days, recovery improved dramatically. My runs felt fresher, and I had a lot more energy to give.\n\n### Race Day\nEdmonton is known for being a fast, flat course. Combined with how my long runs had gone, I felt cautiously optimistic. The weather, though, was a concern: 12\u00b0C at the start, climbing to 21\u00b0C by late morning.\n\nThe race started on the dot at 7:00 am, and the first half went smoothly. I cruised comfortably at 5:50\u20135:55/km. My heart rate stayed near the lower end of Zone 3.  Fueling was consistent: A gel every 30 minutes, and small sips of water every two km or so. Around 20 km, I felt a tiny twinge in my left hamstring, but a short walk break cleared it up and it never returned.\n\nAt the halfway mark, the course loops past the start/finish, and my family was there, cheering me on at the top of their voices. It was the perfect morale boost!\n\nThings started to shift after 25 km, when my pace drifted to 6:20, then 6:30. I wasn\u2019t too worried. My goal pace wasn\u2019t set in stone; I was more focused on finishing well than hitting a number. \n\nAnd then, right at 32 km, [the wheels came off](https://imgur.com/11TU34j) -- almost comically in line with what so many other race reports on this sub describe. \n\nFirst, I felt a cramp in my right shoulder, followed quickly by one in what I think was the serratus. Like the hamstring earlier, both cleared up quickly and never came back. Finally, my calves started spasming. Not really painful, but on the edge of locking up if I didn\u2019t back off and walk. From then on, I alternated short runs with frequent walk breaks. \n\nMeanwhile, the sun was out in full force, the temperature had climbed above 20\u00b0C, and the course felt endless. Edmonton\u2019s route isn\u2019t exactly scenic: mostly suburban sprawl, no shade, nothing to distract from the grind except for a glimpse of downtown at the start/finish. I was miserable.\n\nI tried to set small targets -- run 1 km, then walk -- but even that became too much. At times, I could barely manage 500 m before the calves forced another break. My pace cratered to around 8:15/km. Strangely, I didn\u2019t feel all that fatigued. Maybe the walk breaks kept my heart rate low, or maybe the calf issues just masked everything else.\n\nCrowd support kept me alive. Every cheer, every clap, helped me shuffle forward. And in the back of my mind, I kept telling myself: \"My wife, my kids, my parents are all there to watch \u2026 _no way am I DNF\u2019ing_.\"\n\nEventually, I crossed the finish line, _running_, in 4:39:30. Way off the sub-4 dream, and far from the strong finish I imagined, but it was a finish. My family was there cheering, and that moment made every bit of suffering worth it. And to top it off, I walked away with a massive medal haul: the kids made full use of the activity stations and proudly draped their creations around my neck afterward.\n\n### Assessment\nThis not the race I dreamed of, but exactly the kind of first-marathon experience I half-expected: plenty of suffering, plenty of lessons. Here are mine:\n\n* A marathon training block is intense. 60 km/week stretches you thin when you\u2019re juggling work and family.\n\n* I can't trust Garmin's DSW for race-specific training anymore. I\u2019ll stick to one of the established plans next time. A longer buildup and more volume are essential to make my legs marathon-ready. Higdon's Novice Plans seem to work well for most people, and they also cut down training days to four a week. \n\t\n* ChatGPT makes for a passable interim coach, or maybe that's just my survivor's bias talking. \n\n* Summer marathons are brutal. Running in 20\u00b0C+ with no shade is not my idea of fun. I\u2019ll stick to spring/fall races next time.\n\n* Marathon fatigue hits differently. In the final third of a 10K, I\u2019m usually gasping for air, heart redlining, lungs burning. In the marathon, the wasn\u2019t my heart or lungs that failed me, but pure muscular breakdown.\n\t\nDespite the blow-up, I\u2019m glad I did it. I knew a debut could go sideways, and it did -- but I learned a lot. I stayed injury-free, gutted it out instead of stepping off the course when things fell apart, and crossed the finish line.\n\nI get to call myself a \"marathoner\" now. That is good enough. For the time being. \n\n___\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "title": "Zone 2 not intense enough for optimal exercise benefits, new review says",
    "selftext": "So I think we've all heard the idea that zone 2 (described as an easy intensity where you're able to hold a conversation) is the optimal intensity for most of your runs and the best way to build your aerobic base. Beginners should focus on this zone and they will get faster even by running slow. When you're more intermediate, you can start adding intensity. This was what I always heard when I started running more regularly this year. And I believed it to be true, so most of my runs have been at this zone 2 type intensity.\n\nWell, turns out that this idea is not supported by evidence. A new review of the literature suggests that focusing on zone 2 might not be intense enough to get all the benefits from exercise that you can get from higher intensities.\n\nThe review **looked specifically at mitochondrial capacity and fatty acid oxidative (FAO) capacity** and makes the following conclusion:\n\n* \"Evidence from acute studies demonstrates small and inconsistent activation of mitochondrial biogenic signaling following Zone 2 exercise. Further, the majority of the available evidence **argues against the ability of Zone 2 training to increase mitochondrial capacity** \\[my emphasis\\], a fact that refutes the current popular media narrative that Zone 2 training is optimal for mitochondrial adaptations.\"\n* \"Zone 2 does appear to improve FAO capacity in untrained populations; however, pooled analyses suggest that **higher exercise intensities may be favorable in untrained and potentially required in trained** \\[my emphasis\\] individuals.\"\n\nWhat does this mean? My takeaway is this: There is no reason to focus on zone 2. In order to get better at running in the most efficient way, you need to run the largest amount of time in the highest intensity you can without getting injured.\n\nI'm curious to hear your reactions to this paper. Does this change anything in how you approach your training?\n\nGood interview with one of the authors here: [https://youtu.be/QQnc6-z7AO8](https://youtu.be/QQnc6-z7AO8)\n\nLink to the paper (paywalled): [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40560504/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40560504/)\n\nPaper downloadable here: [https://waltersport.com/investigaciones/much-ado-about-zone-2-a-narrative-review-assessing-the-efficacy-of-zone-2-training-for-improving-mitochondrial-capacity-and-cardiorespiratory-fitness-in-the-general-population/](https://waltersport.com/investigaciones/much-ado-about-zone-2-a-narrative-review-assessing-the-efficacy-of-zone-2-training-for-improving-mitochondrial-capacity-and-cardiorespiratory-fitness-in-the-general-population/)",

Identifying high-risk running sessions in a 5200-person cohort study](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/07/bjsports-2024-109380.long) \n\nThey found that the usual acute:chronic ratio (e.g Garmin training load) type thing isn't predictive of injury. The risk was basically flat or even decreased slightly both with increasing training load and increasing weekly distance. Instead they say if you run more than 110% of the distance of the longest run in the past 30 days, injury risk goes up significantly. \n\nI'm coming back from a long-standing injury so I thought it was pretty interesting. I don't know if I'll disregard weekly mileage or load totally, but this says you should also watch the per run distance and ramp that up slowly.\n\nEDIT: I probably got the definition of acute:chronic ratio ACWR wrong above. It\u2019s not TSS or Garmin training load. It seems to be defined as (running distance in week 4) / (average running distance in weeks 1,2,3) where week 4 would be the current or latest week.",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone, long time lurker first time poster. This didn't feel like it fit in the training or race report threads as my aim is to share this resource to those in a similar position as I was and endorse this training plan!\n\nBriefly, I do not identify as a runner in particular, but am generally well rounded in fitness training. A few months ago I signed up to a charity race with some colleagues (several of whom very much are runners!) and we made a commitment to all try and set PBs with sub-20 minutes 5km race time, whilst raising money for a good cause.\n\nAs someone who would run every now and again as part of a training history that in particular pays more attention to strength and conditioning, I sought out a training plan to focus these efforts for someone who has some base fitness, but isn\u2019t a particularly advanced runner. I came across \\[this article\\](https://www.mymottiv.com/5k-race/advanced-5k-training-plan) by Amanda Wendorff. I bastardised an intermediary of the 8 and 12 week plans into 10 weeks, then followed the programme damn near to a T. It took my 5km time from an (estimated) 23min down to 19m29s and I would like to share my experience here as an endorsement of this article / the training contained within.\n\n***Background***\n\nMale, mid-30s, 5\u201910\u201d, military background (so on the fitter side of average but nothing special). Past few years have been strength training focused and not much intensive running since late 20-teens. Before this programme I would do the odd park-run type thing or charity race, the kind of person who would sign up to a 10 miler and without training specifically for it finish in about 80mins. At the start of this training I weighed 91kg. I have no fancy trainers or running gear and used a Garmin Instinct 2 for pacing and HR monitoring throughout training. I took no supplmentation whilst running, although from approx week 5 (as described below) did modify my diet slightly to aid weight loss as we got closer to race day, at which point I was approx 87kg. I do not smoke, I drink sporadically / socially (avg 1.2 units per day across this training period) and generally prioritise rest & sleep sufficiently to recover well.\n\n***The Programme***\n\nFollowing the above linked article, training weeks were split into 4 sessions. To fit my work schedule, I planned Mondays as the \u201cintense\u201d run (generally high interval and anaerobic training), Wednesdays as the \u201csteady\u201d run (threshold and tempo training), Saturdays as the long run and Sundays as the easy run.\n\nAll intense / steady workouts have a planned 10min warm-up (with strides) and 10min cool-downs which are supposed to be HR based \u2013 in reality, my warm up was running to my preferred running location, which included a big old hill, at a comfortable slow jog with strides down the far side of the hill. Generally this naturally kept to the HR limitation and my cool-down would involve the reverse of said hill, so no way in hell getting my HR down to the target zone, but albeit an easy(ish) jog of 9-10min/miles was typical. During the 20 training sessions, I completed at least 15 of the planned warm ups / cool downs, but a few were halved in time to fit the training in on certain days when I was forced to run during lunch breaks at work etc..\n\nPaces for easy and long runs were based on Z1 and Z2 heartrates, so realistically for me meant HR<150 bpm being the determining factor for completing these workouts.\n\nPaces for intense and steady workouts were formulated in accordance with the article and therefore based on my \\*target\\* speed of 6m27s per mile (unapologetically I work in miles, sorry!), using Z3-Z5.\n\nWith paces and zones all calculated, I created my training plan using Garmin Connect and at the start of each week deleted the previous intense / steady run plan from my watch and uploaded the 2 new ones. Simple! About an hour\u2019s prep and then minimum fuss to follow for the 10 weeks after \u2013 I am not one who enjoys having to think about what I\u2019m doing when running, I like the technology to be counting / timing and pacing for me.\n\n***Comments***\n\nI was very keen to keep strength training concurrently during this programme, lifting 4x / week at a low volume and predominantly upper body... but by about week 4 the cumulative fatigue was simply too much and I could feel both lifts and runs starting to suffer. As a result, I cut resistance training and had 1 full body session (low volume) once a week, usually Thursday as advised by the article but occasionally Friday.\n\nAbout this time I had noted that my weight had dropped slightly \u2013 not unexpected \u2013 and around 5 week made a concious effort to allow this to continue. The only modification to my diet was to replace my not inconsiderable work lunch (5x / week) with Huel and otherwise eat as I normally would, including snacking on various fruit across the day. That was sufficient to keep the weight loss at a steady 0.5-0.75kg/week, and although often peckish during the day, not feel like I was depriving myself at any stage or overly hungry.\n\nOtherwise I stuck religiously to the programme. I made all paces programmed with the exception of Intense 2 and Intense 7 \u2013 the intervals were too hard and I slipped out of goal paces for multiple intervals in both as the workout progressed. Having pace targets of a range was gratifying in that I could achieve the vast majority of workouts even on low energy days, if I put in a great deal of effort. And on high energy days I would be in the faster range of aim pace. So in both respects, the mental battle / post-workout euphoria was always gratifying! I did not feel myself getting faster or fitter particularly, but in hindsight progress week to week was a steady improvement that is visible over the month-to-month span. The programme ends with an intentional taper as expected before a race.\n\n***Race Day***\n\nFor the actual race, our strongest runner (who very much does identify as a runner and as has a sub-17m 5km time!) acted as our pacer and intentionally wanted to \u201csave a little time in the bag in case we needed it\u201d towards the end, so was pacing us to 6m18s miles \u2013 something he only told us as we started and too late to discuss! Given the programme does not really simulate a 5k well in the weeks leading up to the race, it was very hard to gauge if I would have the legs and I had to put complete faith in the training plan. And in truth, without the pacer I doubt I would have put in as strong a performance as I did on the day. Either way...\n\nIt worked. Finishing the first mile was difficult, but I wasn\u2019t blowing as we hit our first 6m18 aim \u2013 the second mile was starting to kick in as a real mental effort to keep going as we approached 13 minutes, but knowing you\u2019re two thirds complete is a huge boon to carrying on\u2026 as the finish came into sight with a third of a mile left to go, our pacer silently increased slightly to 6min/miles and I started struggling for breath \u2013 around 200y from the finish, I was in full tunnel vision and gasping, fell back from the main group shouting at them to carry on. Hindsight checking my garmin, they must have gone for the sprint finish we\u2019d all joked about as my \u2018falling back\u2019 pace to the end was 5m50s/mile and we all smashed our sub-20min target by at least 30 seconds. My HR hit 194 for 30 seconds in that last stretch (it had never exceeded 190 in training), but the 40 training sessions totally approx 35hrs running did the trick and I cannot endorse \\[this training article\\](https://www.mymottiv.com/5k-race/advanced-5k-training-plan) by Amanda Wendorff strongly enough to anyone of reasonable shape who wants to chip down their 5k time relatively quickly.\n\nComments and critiques of the article welcome please.",

So far, the focus has been on consistency, aerobic base, and staying injury-free.\n\n# Training Choices\n\n* Running almost every day (mostly Zone 2, +1-hour runs)\n* VO2 max and sprint intervals a couple times a week\n* Cross-training with bouldering and calisthenics\n* Core strength training\n* Volume at \\~85km per week with minimal burnout\n\n# Pre-Race\n\n* Ate a banana \\~30 minutes before starting\n* Wore my Asics Novablast 5 (first race in them)\n* Carried a trail vest with electrolyte drink (sipped every 15 mins)\n* Took carb gummies every 15 mins \u2014 trying out fueling strategy for longer efforts\n\n# Race Breakdown\n\n* KM 1: 4:20 \u2013 went out too hot\n* KM 2: 5:13 \u2013 reeled it back\n* KM 3: 5:20 \u2013 started locking into rhythm\n* KM 4\u201310: steady between 5:35\u20135:45/km, doing loops around a 1km park\u2013 relaxed form, focused breathing, consistent cadence\n\n# Mindset\n\nI feel like I'm entering a completely new zone. Running gives me this insane feeling of peace \u2014 like I\u2019m in a Zen temple retreat, totally in the moment. No distractions, just me and the movement. That feeling has become just as important as the metrics.\n\n# What\u2019s Next\n\n* Keep building toward my 4:40/km 10K in October\n* Incorporate more strides, hill sprints, and strength work\n* Stick to the joy: running + bouldering + calisthenics\n* Run my first ultramarathon before the end of the year\n\nAlso worth noting: **My race prediction from the watch has gone from 4:08:46 to 3:31:28 for the marathon.** I haven\u2019t actually run a full yet, so I take it with a grain of salt \u2014 but it keeps me motivated and dreaming big.\n\n# Would love to hear from you\n\n* Is this progress promising for someone aiming to move into ultras, and in general, a beginner?\n* Have you made the jump from max running half-marathons into ultras? If so, how has this journey been like?\n* How much trust do you place in Garmin\u2019s race predictions? \n\nThanks for reading \u2014 I\u2019m just getting started and really open to sharing progress stories. Let\u2019s gooo !!!",

    "title": "Learn from my injury recovery mistakes!",
    "selftext": "Skip to the end for TL; DR.\n\nBack in December, while training for my first half marathon, I twisted my ankle in a deep hole in the sidewalk. I went down hard and ended up a little bloody. I could not bear any weight on my ankle and had to sit on the sidewalk for several minutes before hobbling home. Once home, I RICEd it and went on to work. I knew it was sprained; it was obvious by the swelling and pain, but I figured it would go away on its own. I am one of those stubborn men that doesn't like going to the doctor for these sorts of things because they will \"get better on their own.\" After about a week, I tried to run on it again, even though it still hurt and was clearly swollen. This made the pain and swelling worse. Fast forward three weeks, and several more unsuccessful attempts to run on it, and my wife finally convinced me to go to the doctor.\n\nAt first, they thought it might be fractured, which would have sucked, but I told myself I could deal with the downtime. Then we did an MRI just to make sure it wasn't something more serious. Spoiler alert, it was! Turns out I had a grade three ATFL sprain. Yikes! Treatment? One full month non-weight bearing, followed by another month of light weight bearing (in boot), and then PT for a minimum of 6 weeks. Double yikes! Thank the Lord they didn't want to do surgery, but this recovery timeline still sucked. The ortho and my GP made it pretty clear that had I gone in sooner, there may have been a chance my recovery would have been shorter, and there's a good chance it wasn't that bad until I tried to run on it repeatedly.\n\nHonestly, the physical part of the recovery wasn't so bad. I think that is because I followed my PT's advice very carefully when it came to my rehab exercises. However, I struggled mentally. Pretty hard. You see, before I started running and eating a clean diet, I was borderline obese. I started running as a means to lose weight, which I did successfully (down 60+ pounds), but it went from a chore to a hobby very quickly. I ran for the fun of it, not out of necessity. It became a very important outlet for me, like my own therapy in a way. A time for me to unplug, get outside, and just connect with myself. Not to mention how great it felt whenever I achieved a running-related goal that I once thought was impossible. Now, in my mind, a very important part of my routine, and honestly my life, had been forcefully taken away, and I could do nothing but wait until I was recovered.\n\nI started to over-restrict my calories. Started overdoing it in the gym in other ways. Started to eat more ultra-processed foods that I had previously given up. I tried to live a more \"gym-bro\" centered life. I was terrified that if I didn't do SOMETHING, then I would lose all my progress. What I didn't realize was that I was likely making things worse by doing this. The wake-up call again came from my wife, who saw my gloomy mood, saw that I was reverting back to bad habits, and realized that this whole thing was taking its toll on me. One day, she finally said something to me, and it woke me up. I realized how terrible I felt every day, physically and mentally, and thought back to how I felt before when I was less restrictive and just focused on eating for health vs trying desperately not to gain weight that took me more than a decade to gain in the first place. I was overtraining any way I could without injuring my ankle more in an attempt to keep myself busy and find an outlet, even though I likely should have been resting more and allowing my body to heal.\n\nSo, I started to focus more on wellness again, treated my body with grace, and now seven months after my injury, I feel better than ever and I am running again! Everyone focuses on the physical part of recovery, but man does the mental stuff take its toll. I definitely learned a lot through this experience.\n\nTL; DR - learn from my mistakes. If you are injured or think you may be, don't \"wait it out.\" Get it checked, and for the love of all that is holy, follow the physio/PT's guidance and timeline. While recovering, don't be afraid to talk to someone about your mental health if you are struggling.",

    "selftext": "Hi! So kinda long:\n\nI began running last year using couch to 5k and got to running 30 mins consecutive (I was a whole 10kg heavier when I started). Took a 7 month break from November for health reasons and returned and trained up again around June. Got to running 30 mins by the 5th week, skipping bits of couch to 5k and l've been doing that three times a week for two weeks now (6 weeks now into this).\n\nOnly problem; these last three runs have been crazy difficult - mentally and also my legs feel heavy? Like I know I can run 30 mins but I keep telling myself I'll stop in 5 mins to get through it, and my legs are like dead weights. My speed's dropped a bit and my heart rate readings seem like they've gone up a bit (I segment every 5 mins on the workout Apple Watch so I can look back on it). I'm kind of confused because before 15 minutes would pass by quickly and I could keep a faster pace throughout with a sprinter finish.\n\nToday's Friday so l've done my third run of the week, I have two days before my next run, my week usually looks like this: \nrun + strength, \nPilates, \nrun, \nstrength, \nrun, \nSteps and some light core \nrest\n\nand outside of running I get 10k steps in every day even on my rest days. I don't do heavy lifting just body weight and a little extra.\n\nI do my workouts at home and it's nothing crazy - usually push ups, weighted table rows, wall sits, leg raises and glute bridges, dead bugs, Russian twists etc. Depending on the day.\n\nI'm a bit perplexed. Not sure if it's just me still adjusting to 30 min intervals considering so far it's been progressive overloads? I wanted to increase the run length to get to the stage where I can run marathons but I don't know if now's the time for that when I'm ready to just stop after 15-20 minutes.\n\nBefore this happened, I was genuinely enjoying running, l'd be smiling through it (until the last stretch where l'm tired but still able to get a sprint finish in and go really fast - for me) and it felt freeing. I did think it was maybe down to my cycle, but then it also doesn't make sense because when I was meant to feel lighter I felt dead.",

To that respect, barefoot and minimal shoes can help, but there is no advice for (or maybe rather even advice against) using barefoot/minimal shoes without long and good training and without rotation with other types of shoes (unless you grew up without wearing any shoes, then pure barefoot running might be the best choice).",

Mostly long runs, easy runs with at least one interval or strides run per week.  For my next race I plan to increase to 4x / week.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThis is the first race I've signed up for in a long time and I wasn't really a runner before so it never occurred to me that there could be \"scam\" races out there. The \"we'll send out the course map a few days before the race\" description should have been a tell-tale sign and sure enough, a week before the race we get the \"course\" map: A stretch of running path that is approximately 0.7 miles long.\n\nIt wasn't until the night before the race that I realized the \"course\" was 0.7 miles, I mistakenly thought it was 1.5 so I'd only need to do two out-and-backs.  But I used a footpath app to see it would in fact be...four-ish out-and-backs.\n\nWhat's worse? There's an intersection right in the middle of this 0.7 mile stretch :facepalm: that I had to cross 8 times.\n\nAnyway, the organization consisted of: two very nice and helpful coordinators who gave out bibs, a snack station near their sign-in area, a couple traffic cones by the \"starting line\", and instructions that \"you can start whenever you like.\"  The organizing body is called \"The Best Races\" and I get the impression all of their events are like this.\n\nThere was a pretty decent turnout.  But about half of the people who showed up were wearing shirts for some charity run to fight breast cancer.  Turns out \"The Best Races\" was hosting the same run with two brands - the one I signed up for and [Run Together Against Breast Cancer](https://findarace.com/us/events/run-together-against-breast-cancer-5k-10k-13-1-los-angeles).  I would seriously question the legitimacy of the charity run.\n\nFor some reason, a week or two before the race, the organizers encouraged registrants to select a starting time but this turned out to be pointless as no one was organizing heats of runners on the day-of.\n\n# Race\n\nWhatever, I trained to crush a 10k and that's what I set out to do.  Like every rookie runner, I started too fast, even though everyone says not to start too fast, and regretted that around mile 3.\n\nOccasionally I had to sprint to make it across the intersection before the light changed (or sometimes right after) and that messed up the consistency of my pace almost every time.  Once or twice I had to stop and wait for the walk sign.\n\nAround miles 4 and 5 I saw my pace slipping but didn't feel like I had the energy to bring it back up.  But I remembered a \"secret weapon\" I discovered during training which was faster cadence - by increasing my cadence and maintaining a good posture I would run faster without feeling like I was exerting more effort.  Worked every time!  Runna didn't prepare me for this, a random coworker mentioned it, so thanks for that, Bailey.  This kept me within my goal pace the rest of the way.\n\n# Post-race\n\nGot a banana at the check in station, walked around Santa Monica's running path / pier a bit.  Street parking was free until 9am.\n\nSo I wouldn't say this race was a scam, exactly, it just had many scam-like qualities.  But they did mail me a race shirt, hand out bibs and snacks, and gave out stickers.  And parking was super easy and free.  I guess I don't mind too much that I did this instead of a legitimate race because I'm just getting started, but guaranteed I will not be doing a \"The Best Races\" run again.  Especially when the strand beach path that goes miles and miles along the beach was right that and would have been a much nicer alternative.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "I spent the past 13 years in NYC, running almost as long, and started attending running clubs maybe four years ago. Running groups are plenty in NYC and tend to be informally organized and smaller (<30 people). Even the most well-known clubs aren't that big. Most groups host runs at least a few times a week and do something after (e.g., a cafe). With the small size, it's super easy to get to know regulars and make friends.\n\nCue my surprise coming out to LA and being told by locals that running is big here. For such a big area, LA really doesn't have many run clubs, and they're all HUGE.  The Venice Run Club apparently gets hundreds of people per run?!  The only run club that size in NYC is Midnight Runners, which I didn't like attending because it's too large and too anonymous.  Run clubs are super polished and manicured, too, with slick websites, branded merchandise, etc.\n\nI'm surprised because LA is huge geographically and there are so many places to run, and commuting sucks--you'd think there would be smaller micro groups, but there aren't (or at least, I have not found them).\n\nThat makes me wonder about running club culture elsewhere. What is it like where you live? Is LA the norm? Is NYC? Somewhere in between?\n\n(Also, if my impression of LA is wrong, please tell me! I really would love to find a smaller running group in West LA to make friends :( )",

    "selftext": "I was recently told by my podiatrist that I need to wear a larger size shoe (in general, not just running). Basically, I was using a tight heel and toes to keep my foot from sliding in the shoe, which was bad for my nail matrices. After reading a bit, it sounded like many people like a thumb width between their toes and the end of their running shoes, so I also bought bigger running shoes (up 1 1/2 sizes, which tells you how cramped they were).\n\nEdit: to clarify, I was wearing 1 - 1 1/2 sizes below what I measured, so he was not suggesting wearing some that was 1 -1 1/2 sizes too big, just bigger.\n\nMy problem is that now, in order to keep my foot from sliding forward, I have to use the laces to lock the foot back. I've tried several ways to tie my shoes, including the traditional method, the runner's lock (creating loops in the last two eyelets that the laces then pass through), and several modified versions of the lock. Regardless of what I do, to keep my heel back, it feels painfully tight on the tendons right at the bend (under where the laces usually cross last). Even avoiding having the laces cross directly over that spot by going from the upper eyelets directly to lower ones, only helped slightly.\n\nI can run with it that way, but it is not at all comfortable, leaving that spot tender afterwords. I've experienced this in both Hoka Clifton 8's and Saucony TR17's.\n\nAm I missing something? Any suggestions? Padding?\n\nEdit: Sorry for my delayed responses.

For anyone who happens across this again, I did it and I cried and I am so proud of myself. \n\nI\u2019m athletic and love sports but man I hate running. So like any sane person I signed up for the Chicago marathon and got it. I\u2019ve been training for a while now since I can\u2019t run a mile without walking. I\u2019ve gotten my mileage up to ten miles so far and am on track with a marathon plan. It\u2019s just I\u2019m super slow (13 min miles since I\u2019m walking parts) and I feel like everything\u2019s going wrong. Turns out I have mild compartment syndrome in my calf and my doctor wants an mri for my other knee since he thinks there could be complications there too. I just feel so injury prone but I\u2019m doing everything right (PT, stretching, doctor). I want to do this. I want to run the marathon and I think I can I\u2019m just scared. What if I do it and don\u2019t finish? I know it happens to people and that\u2019s their story but I would be embarrassed and sad and just I\u2019m scared. Thanks for reading my rant and I guess I want to see if anyone else was scared before their first marathon and how do you get over it/what was making you scared or not scared\n\nPositive vibes only please\n\nEdit: addressing some comments - I do have the okay from PT and doctor to run it. I\u2019m not worried about what my final time would be, I just want to be able to cross that finish line!",

    "selftext": "I just heard an interview with the people behind this study, the Garmin Runsafe study (link below), and they say that we should worry much more about the impact of the single run than the accumulated runs over time (the 10 percent rule etc) when it comes to injury.\n\n\"The study suggests that overuse injuries don\u2019t develop over time, as previously believed, explains Rasmus \u00d8stergaard Nielsen, associate professor and senior researcher at the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University and one of the researchers behind the study.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that overuse injuries occur much more frequently during a single training session when the runner runs too far compared to what they are used to,\u201d he says.\n\nSo even though some running programs suggest increasing your distance by 10 or 20 percent on your next run, according to the new study, that's far too much, says Rasmus \u00d8stergaard Nielsen.\n\n\u201cIf we want to stay somewhat safe when increasing our distance, a five percent progression is more sensible. If you're used to running five kilometers, that means you can add just 250 meters on your next run,\u201d he says.\n\nThis means that if, for example, you want to train to run 10 kilometers, you\u2019ll need to set aside a longer period than some running programs recommend.\n\nAdditionally, there are many other factors that can influence your risk of injury. According to Rasmus \u00d8stergaard Nielsen, the study\u2019s findings likely apply to other changes in your running routine as well.\n\n\u201cThat could be running much faster than you\u2019re used to, running in a new pair of shoes where the load is different, or suddenly running a lot on sand when you're used to running on asphalt.\u201d\n\nThere has previously, including in the research community, been a narrative that overuse injuries develop gradually over time, but that cannot be documented, according to Rasmus \u00d8stergaard Nielsen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pulling our hair out for 20 years trying to figure out why we weren\u2019t finding anything. We looked into the individual training sessions, and that\u2019s why we believe our research project has such great potential\u2014it changes the narrative of how injuries occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should view injuries more as something that happens during a single training session, rather than something that develops gradually over time.\u201d\n\nThe study is the largest study of running injuries ever conducted and is based on data from more than 5,200 participants.\n\n\nMy thought is that some of the metrics in our running watches needs to be looked at. \n\nThe study is here: https://www.ucviden.dk/da/publications/a-paradigm-shift-in-understanding-overuse-running-related-injurie\n\nThe quoted article is here:\nhttps://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/nyt-studie-af-loebeskader-omskriver-historien-din-skade-kan-komme-efter-kun-en",

I\u2019m in my forties and returning to running having been out of the game for 8 years and it is so strange going to the specialist stores, the sole thickness is off the charts and the staff are describing the benefits in almost exact opposite terms to the early 2000s. My preference has always been to have a good feel for the ground, not in a barefoot running way but in a what I would class as normal sole kind of way but options like that seem long gone.

I still have a workout preset saved on my watch called 'Tempo 1' consisting of x5 1 km (I thought anything over 800m was too long to count as an interval). I was anxious about never having done any serious training or anything close to a half-mara distance before, so I trained for about 20 weeks all up (albeit starting at a pretty low intensity/mileage of 20-30 km per week for the first half of training).\n\nGoals-wise, I had initially just set out to finish somewhere within 1:46-1:55 when I signed up for the race in January, but as with training going well I decided to push harder for sub 1:45. After a particularly good track session about 8 weeks out, I was feeling competitive and cranked it to 1:40, although I didn't actually think I could do it once the cockiness wore off a few days later. But I decided to stick to it anyway because 'aim for the moon and you'll land among the stars'.\n\nOver time, I developed a 4-run weekly split which normally looked like the following:\n\nTuesday: 7-10k either tempo or easy\n\nThursday: a track session - either I'd do a progression run (if I'd done an easy run on Tuesday) or intervals (8x400, 4x100, or 6x1k) with a long warm up/cool down. This would usually total 10-13k in distance.\n\nSaturday: fast parkrun, followed by another easy 5k\n\nSunday: long run of 10-16k typically, with the longest being 18.5k\n\nI peaked at 51 km 5 weeks prior to the race, but kept running 45+ km for another 2 weeks before tapering.\n\nMy final run before the taper was a particularly fast 12k progression run one Saturday after a Friday night out, which resulted in me straining my left achilles (which still hasn't gone away completely). I felt the niggle as I was walking home, not thinking much of it - I actually thought it was a surface wound and I'd just nicked the skin from walking too far in heels the night before.\n\nWent out again for my usual Tuesday and Thursday runs (both short and easy, about 5k at 5:30/km pace for my taper) and it wasn't going away. I was scared out of my wits since I'd heard for years that there was no running injury more vindictive than an achilles. But I could still walk, it wasn't hurting enough to stop me from running completely, and I had faith.\n\nI began fanatically researching, icing, and eccentric heel-dropping with only one week to go. Bought KT tape, kept stretching and resting, only ran easy, about 16 kms in the final week before the race on Sunday. I'd developed a habit of going to parkrun every week, so I went as usual for my shakeout to help settle my nerves. It felt good, the air was nice, the achilles felt ok, and I was feeling at least sort of confident for the race again.\n\n### Pre-race\nI got out of bed at about 3:30 am after a night of tossing and turning. The night had been a cycle of reading race reports on this sub and then drifting off phone in hand, only to start awake after 20 mins, convinced that I was already late. But race day adrenaline REALLY is something else. My heart was pounding through to my skull already, and I was ready to jump 6 feet into the air at the slightest sound outside on the street, even despite getting barely any rest.\n\nI made and ate my breakfast of oatmeal and frozen raspberries with peanut butter and honey. Drank my coffee, which did what I needed it to do after some squats and lunges. Full makeup and braided my hair - got to be prepared in case those race photos were going to be my last.\n\nMy parents took me (dad drove and mum came with me to the start line), about a 30 min drive. The whole way there I sat in the back like a little kid, rocking back and forth in my seat, shaking quietly and questioning why I thought this was a good idea.\n\nGot there at about 6 am for a 6:40 start in the B wave. I (very stupidly) thought that 30 mins before the race start would be enough for a bathroom trip since the toilets were close by - it definitely wasn't and I could see the lines bending around the portables. Seeking alternative solutions, I set off circling the area for bushes to pretty much no avail - there was a bit of shrubbery in a patch of mud but I didn't want to ruin my white shoes and risk slipping in the mud with my shorts around my ankles.\n\nDecided to just hold it - I wasn't busting desparately anyway, and it might've just been me starting to overthink every small twinge in my state of pre-race panic. Taped up my ankle, tied my ribbons into my hair, chugged the rest of my Gatorade (yes despite my bladder concerns minutes earlier), and made my way into the corral.\n\n### Race\nTypical rookie move of starting out FAST. My goal pace was 4:46/km (or a few seconds under) to finish in 1:40, and setting off I felt pretty steadied and was shuffling along with the crowd at what I thought was a fairly conservative speed. Glanced down at my watch about 1 km in and I'd gone through it in 4:36.\n\nI was surprised and I also wasn't given the adrenaline wave I'd barely been bridling, but I was anxious that only 5% into the race I might already be heading towards a crash and burn. But it was race day and I couldn't have stomached holding back and leaving anything on the table - what if I could push through? I decided I'd hold steady for the time being and just dial back if I started feeling it too early.\n\nThe first 10k felt amazing, the course was scenic, and there was a beautiful sunrise coming up as we ran by the water (a very nice change from the neverending laps around the same two concrete circuits and red 400m that made up most of my training). It wasn't overly busy just yet and I could see quite far ahead, which made it easy to run the tangents and I was cruising through the almost totally flat paths thus far. I went through the 10k mark at 46:12. Started thinking, maybe I really can do this.\n\nStopped (well, still half-running because I was terrified of slowing down) at the aid station 12k in. My steps threw half of my cup of water in my face, so I probably gulped a quarter of it and wore the rest. I was still feeling all right, not fully suffering yet, but my heart rate was rising from the steady low 150s to the high 150s and entering the 160s. By this point, I was halfway and starting to think about the end - the first half was good primarily because I didn't let myself acknowledge the distance left (I don't think I could've held pace if I'd told myself at 4k that I'd have to do this for another 17). 9 km left was at least in the single digits, a lot less threatening. But my legs were starting to ache, blisters were coming in, and I had now reached the roll of the first hill.\n\nThe strait of 12k to 16k, it was like all the runners were surfing a massive 4 km long wave. The uphills were difficult in either length or incline, but not both, and there was still plenty of relief in the downhill we were rewarded with for every climb. I think I made a lot of my race in the first 10k and also in this section, as I kept a pretty straight path and used gravity to fly down the hills (slow cadence, long strides, low arms) while I slowed to save energy on the ascents. Actually, this was pretty much the theme of the rest of the race as the hills got steeper, which you can see from my splits in the last half. Funnily enough, I finished with 4 back-to-back 23-minute 5ks - exactly 4:37/km pace in each segment. It evened out I guess!\n\nThe push through 17, 18, 19k, fighting demons. That one climb at 17k was UNRELENTING (Anderson St Hill - straight from hell). You could feel the evil force of gravity trying to drag us all backwards and tumble us on heavy legs that didn't have much left to resist with. In my photos you can see me leaning forwards almost clawing my way up, I felt like somehow I could pull myself upwards by the arms to the crest.\n\nWhat got me through this was my mum finding me just at the relief of that ascent as I passed the 18k mark. Once I saw her, I yelled, waved, I felt a sudden rush and picked up the pace, and went for the full send. 3 km left, it was go time - I was gritting my teeth and ramping up for the last push to empty the tank.\n\nAs I hit 20k, I looked at my watch again and it said 1:32:something. That left me with over 7 minutes to run the last 1.1 km, which I knew I could do even on my worst days. I wish I hadn't looked, because I was in pain by this point and I might've been able to push harder if I hadn't had that confidence that I would reach my goal. But I crossed the finish smiling wide and happy that I'd made it. (Before doubling over in direct line of finishing photography.)\n\n### Post-race\nMy mum was there to catch me at the finish line and she told me my result - she held my phone during the race and the preliminary result had already come through. Almost 3 whole minutes ahead of my target!!! Now I'm not usually the most physically expressive person ever, but there I was jumping for joy, whooping, arms in the air, feeling like I'd just conquered the world.\n\nWe walked back towards Flinders after, coffee and cake at Brunetti, the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. Grill'd for lunch too, I was almost expecting not to have much of an appetite but I ate like no tomorrow. We talked about the race, went through all the photos, laughing at the race shots (glad I lived to tell the tale because those photos could CERTAINLY not be my last). I'm so beyond grateful to my mum and I could never had made it without knowing she was cheering me the whole way.\n\nAfter getting home: ate, bath, bed, movie, 8 hr sleep. EXCRUCIATING DOMS.\nI'm walking, but it will be more of a hobble for probably at least the next couple days.",

    "selftext": "Exactly as the title states. I have a bubble butt - thick thigh combo, and every time I try something other than a biker short or a short with a very long inseam, it fails me. It\u2019s a little harder because my waist is slimmer than my lower body, so it either fits one or the other. I often see women running with the cute V-cut shorts that are a little flowy I am wondering if I\u2019m missing out! I\u2019m kind of sick of the daily runner biker short only look, they\u2019re definitely functional and they prevent chafing (until they\u2019re worn through) but maybe I haven\u2019t found what will be my new bff for the cute but functional chafe game! I do have bodyglide and I lay it on thick but sometimes it just doesnt cut it and the shorts I do have ride up (which is rather unflattering and uncomfortable digging the fabric out every 2 minutes). Maybe I\u2019m looking for something that doesn\u2019t exist. Maybe you wonderful people will lead me to the promised land product. I figured if anyone would know, it\u2019s yall! Bonus points for high waist, maybe with a drawstring to actually fit the waist, and pockets. Thank you in advance!! \n\nP.S. if there\u2019s any general tips on sizing/fabric/ styles please share! Would love to know what has worked for you in the past\ud83d\udc96",

    "selftext": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Run Melbourne\n* **Date:** 13 July 2025\n* **Distance:** 20.7km\n* **Location:** Melbourne, Australia\n* **Time:** 2:04:23\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 2:20 | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 2:30 | *Yes* |\n| C | Finish! | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometer | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 6:09\n| 2 | 6:17\n| 3 | 6:09\n| 4 | 5:58\n| 5 | 6:01\n| 6 | 6:08\n| 7 | 6:01\n| 8 | 5:55\n| 9 | 5:56\n| 10 | 5:51\n| 11 | 5:53\n| 12 | 5:56\n| 13 | 5:48\n| 14 | 5:58\n| 15 | 5:51\n| 16 | 6:10\n| 17 | 6:13\n| 18 | 5:47\n| 19 | 6:02\n| 20 | 6:01\n| 21 | 5:53\n\n### Training\n\nThis was my first time joining an organized race; Training plan was self designed at 3 runs a week, increasing by not more than 10% weekly mileage with a back off every 4th week. One run would be some kind of speed work, one long run, and one easy run.\n\nI had 6 months to build up, but did pick up a hip injury halfway thru which took me out for 3 weeks. In the following 3 months, training wasn't ideal either as I was plagued with peronneal tendonitis on both feet and had to reduce my mileage (any tips for prehab?)\n\nMy peak volume was 31km at 3 weeks out, with a long run of 17km. Was supposed to do a 18km the following week but feet were hurting so I cut it to a 15km.\n\nDid NO long runs in the final 2.5 weeks, which I thought was a death sentence to any respectable timing. To make things worse, my right peronneals were flaring up real bad in the final week so I did not run at all in the 8 days leading up to race day. \n\n### Pre-race\nThe day before race day, my peronneals hurt so much (every step was sore) I was super bummed and mentally prepared to just walk/run the course. Being my first running event ever, I just tried to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I tempered my expectations from a sub 2:20 to a 'dont DNF'\n\nRace morning, I had a can of Milo and some Julies peanut butter biscuits. Race fuel was 1 SIS gel, 1 GU Cola gel, 1 PURE gel, 1 GU choc (I felt GU gives me the most 'boost' but eating too many GU gels makes my tummy upset, so I tried to mix it up. SIS and PURE go down more easily for me)\n\nI also taped up my right foot based on some random Google link to help my peronneals; midfoot hurt a bit still so I also wrapped 2 lines across my midfoot. Shockingly, this helped immensely and I didn't feel discomfort in my right foot all race!\n\nWeather was 10 deg C which is a very cold run for me, coming from a country with lowest temps at 24 deg C (SG). Donned a secondhand sweater waiting for the start, which I shed before the gun. Race attire was an UA tee, arm sleeves, shorts over running long tights, and gloves.\n\nWas also supposed to start in Wave D (>2:06)), but we (me and my friend) got tired of walking down the long line and just slipped in with the Wave C runners (1:56-2:06) and decided to pace ourselves.\n\n### Race\n0-10km:\n\nWe didn't agree on a pace, but I knew she wanted to finish under 2:10 if possible. I initially wanted to go more conservatively because of my injuries but I decided to follow her as long as I could, as it felt nicer to run with someone.\n\nShe set off pretty quick - my target race pace was 6:30/km (easy run pace during training was 6:50-7) - we were going at 5:15-6:00 in the first few km with some downslopes but settled at around 5:45-6 in the mostly flat first half.\n\nThe first 10km felt pretty chill physically. My feet weren't hurting and 6:00/km was theoretically a fast pace for me, but somehow in the cold weather it felt perfectly manageable and very comfortable. I shed my gloves after about 5km, though with the random gusts of cold wind, it was still an overall very cold race for me even after my body warmed up a bit.\n\nThe route brought us back into the CBD, away from the event village, which meant virtually no supporters. The segment ended off running alongside the river with a nice view of the yachts and city skyline, and we crossed back towards the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\n10-15km:\n\nMy wife was waiting at the Gardens so I was looking forward to this segment and got a hi-five boost at about 11km. This was also where more and more spectators lined the course and made for a more motivating environment. The course was mostly flat still; my ankles and feet started to get more fatigued from this point, but I was surprised I could still hold my pace and keep a steady rhythm.\n\n15-18km:\n\nThe start of a series of climbs. You can actually anticipate it due to the route looping to a turnaround at 15km so you pass everyone coming back on the gentle climb from 15-17km.\n\nI lost my running buddy as she held a strong effort and I just tried to keep a steady rhythm to not blow up as I passed some walkers. The climb got a little steeper 17-18km before levelling out. My left foot had began to hurt but nothing that went beyond 2/5 so thankful for that. \n\n18-20.7km:\n\nI had taken a gel at 5km, 9.5km, 14km. I had planned for one more at 18.5km but my stomach was feeling slightly weird so I skipped the gel but took a full cup of electrolyte drink at the aid station instead.\n\nThis segment was as good as a victory lap. Mentally I knew I was not going to stop even if things started to hurt so I pushed and maintained my rhythm.\n\nThere were many more spectators and you can feel the vibe shift as you get nearer to the end. Every runner was pushing harder which made me push harder too (tho not really reflected in my splits)\n\nThere were still some steep but short climbs near the end that threatened to cramp me up but turned out ok. \n\nWas such a rush running through the finish line with my arms raised as I acknowledged my imaginary fans... And was so pleasantly surprised to smash my goals despite the injury woes leading up to the race.\n\n(The course length turned out about 300m short, but even if I added that I think it's a comfortable sub 2:10!)\n\n### Post-race\nWe walked around the event village to snap photos, grab some small freebies - some choc protein milk, some candy, and nothing much. Is it normal for events not to give a finishers tee/ singlet? Was expecting one and bummed to only have a medal.\n\nQuite an interesting first-time experience running a race effort for '21km', though it was only made possible with the cold weather (my usual training weather is 28-33 deg C). \n\nHad a cheeseburger for lunch but my body was having the shits for most of the day (from gels? From the hard effort?) so couldn't really stomach much food. \n\nWhat's next? Probably do a block of strength training for injury prevention before going into another HM training block to see if I can replicate this timing in hot and humid Singapore. Then maybe, just maybe, a full in 2026?\n\nFor now, everything is sore, but my heart is full.\n\n~~~\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I started running this year to improve my cardiovascular health and maintain a healthy weight (my family has some issues at this point \ud83d\ude05), so staying fit is a long-term goal for me.\n\nI\u2019ve got a sedentary job and lots of stress, so running became my go-to way to reset both physically and mentally.\nNow I\u2019m running about three times a week, carefully alternating techniques. I\u2019ve read different articles on running form, and I try to keep my bounce low to reduce impact and avoid harsh landings. I also always do warm-up stretches before running and cooldown stretches after.\n\nMy diet is about 1500 kcal per day with balanced meals (veggies, meat, fish, etc).\nAfter a while, I really fell in love with running. I\u2019m not chasing pace, just trying to develop solid technique. My goal now is to recover from a minor knee issue and be ready to run a 10K during the Warsaw Marathon events this autumn, and maybe a half marathon next year.\n\nThe issue I\u2019m facing is terrain. My city is hilly, and parks have very uneven paths. Many of the paths are slightly dome-shaped across their width and keep reversing, putting alternating stress on each leg. But running on sports fields became boring almost instantly.\nDespite running carefully in road shoes (Skechers Go Run Max Road 6), the inconsistent surface caused a problem.\n\nI\u2019ve read through many posts here, but it seems I still haven\u2019t found quite what I\u2019m looking for. And I\u2019d really love to hear from others who have dealt with constantly changing terrain.\nHow did you manage to avoid injuries when running on uneven surfaces? What helped in practice?\n\nI\u2019m really motivated to keep going, just want to do it safely and sustainably.\n\nUPD: last time I got my knee injured, so I would also be really glad to hear your advices at this point.",

When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn\u2019t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make /r/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in /r/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner\u2026.and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are /r/runninglifestyle/, /r/BeginnersRunning/, /r/runningquestions/, and /r/Runners/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here. Anything from new PRs, to longest weekly mileage, to running your first ultra \u2013 literally any accomplishments you experienced recently!\n\n* [General Q&A Thread (Posted daily)](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/search?q=Official+Q%26A&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all): With such a large sub, there are a lot of running-related questions that come in every day. In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nmj7pd/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nth0mw/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nsfsw4/the_weekly_training_thread/)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nuc797/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nu4e9l/run_nutrition_tuesday/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nu4e9d/tuesday_shoesday/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nuzflw/lurkers_wednesday/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nuzfm2/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nq5aic/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nqsm0c/the_weekend_thread_for_friday_september_26_2025/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nqris4/race_roll_call/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1nrmn1x/social_saturday/)\n\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as \u201cdrive-by\u201d posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including \u201cSee title\u201d or \u201cTitle says it all\u201d in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown/vague pains, or injuries/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**",

I was mentally and physically drained, and what used to bring me joy started feeling like a chore. I decided to take a break, thinking it\u2019d be just a couple of weeksbut that turned into months. Now I\u2019m finally ready to lace up again, but I feel a bit lost. My pace is slower, endurance is down, and honestly, I\u2019m a little nervous to jump back in. I don\u2019t want to fall into the same trap again.\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve experienced burnout I wanna know how did you reset your mindset? Any routines or fun running goals that helped you reignite the spark? Would you recommend starting with group runs, trail runs, or just solo easy miles? Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "[Below, as reported from WMUR in NH](https://www.wmur.com/article/runner-beats-train-summit-mount-washington-cog-joseph-gray/65243873)\n\n\"A runner from Colorado beat a train to the top of Mount Washington on Saturday [6/28/25].\n\nJoseph Gray, of Colorado, was among about 400 participants in this year's Race the Cog event. He beat the 9 a.m. Cog Railway train to the top of the summit, according to Northeast Delta Dental President and CEO Tom Raffio.\n\nRaffio said Gray was the only runner to beat the train. He completed the race in 39 minutes and 54 seconds. Gray had to run through fog and light rain on steep terrain to complete the run. By beating the train, he got a $1,000 bonus from Northeast Delta Dental, Raffio said.\n\nGray also beat the lead Cog train in 2022. Raffio said beating the lead train to the summit has only happened twice during the event, and both times it was Gray who accomplished the feat.\n\nRunners from across the country take part in the Race the Cog event each year. The course starts at the base station of the Cog Railway in Bretton Woods.\"\n\nMore info:\n\nThe race is as follows: \"Runners will take the path alongside the tracks to the summit of Mount Washington racing the cog [railway] the whole way up! The course begins on dirt/gravel where it gradually becomes steeper as you approach Jacobs Ladder which is about a 37% grade. From Jacobs Ladder the runners will begin to experience the large boulder fields that make up the Presidential Range, one of the most technical areas in the country.  The grueling race then concludes on the lofty summit of Mount Washington, finishing a true test of endurance alongside The Cog. The weather can be extreme and vary significantly. Temperatures can be in the 70\u2019s at the base and then snowing at the Summit. \" Mt. Washington's elevation is 6,288 feet. The race course is about 2.75 miles long and follows the tracks the entire way. The total climbing is 3,500 feet with more than 1,000 feet of climbing per mile.",

The last 6 years I've been a lot more consistent with running as my primary exercise and keeping a decent baseline of fitness. I typically will do at least 1 half marathon race per year and a few other 10k, 10 miler and various trail races to keep things interesting. This would be my second marathon with my first being Jan 2023 which I finished 4hours23minutes.\n\nSince the first full, my running got more consistent and my goal for this was to go sub 4 hours. Through my increased training and other half marathon races I've done, I felt it was achievable but would be tough. My stretch goal was to go sub 3:45, but this was something I didn't really think possible until the race itself.\n\nMy friend found this event last year and we planned a vacation to Norway for it. I live in Colorado so the altitude for training would give me an advantage here as well as this is at sea level. For those not in the know, the race takes place in the arctic circle in a small town called Tromso way up north in Norway (highly recommend visiting if you can!). They do it on June 21st on the summer solstice when the sun never sets and the race starts at 9pm. It was quite bizarre to a) have a race that takes place at night like this but b) be running in complete sunlight at what should be night time. There are huge parties that go on all over Norway during the summer solstice but Tromso especially was wild with the race going on too.\n\nAfter deciding to sign up, my goal was officially to go sub 4 hours. I built a 4ish month plan running 5x per week starting in March based on something I found on the runnersworld site. I got some advice on my plan from some people in my run club who are more seasoned which was awesome and helped a lot.\n\nThe weather in Colorado can be unpredictable in the spring, but thankfully it was mostly good for training and only had a few days where I was forced to use a treadmill. My baseline mileage before starting was about 15-20 miles per week so I did not have any issues with the training. My rest days I would try to do some dedicated stretching and light weight lifting to give my legs a rest. Generally speaking, each week was broken down into this:\n\nMonday: Rest\n\nTuesday: Tempo or Interval Run\n\nWednesday: Easy Run at varying distance or time\n\nThursday: Tempo or Hills\n\nFriday: Rest or cross training with yoga/weights\n\nSaturday: 30minutes easy run\n\nSunday: Long run - 8 miles all the way up to 20 miles then tapering back down a few weeks out\n\nI was able to stick to this format for the most part and only had some slight knee pain towards the end on really big weeks which I would then adjust distances on the other runs as to not over train.\n\nNear the end of the block in May, I ran a half marathon race which I substituted a long run for to get a baseline of where I was fitness wise and double check nutrition/gear. The race could not have gone better and I finished in 1hour53minutes and had plenty of gas in the tank left afterwards. This gave me serious confidence I was on the right track and wouldn't have any issues on the full.\n\nNutrition wise I've been using the same gels, gummies and recovery drinks the past few years so none of that was new for my body thankfully. I also was somehow able to stay healthy and not get sick at all during the training block which was a huge blessing.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nWe flew into Europe the Wednesday before the Saturday race to give us plenty of time to get on schedule there and get some rest. Sleep was interesting with the sun not setting basically at all, but the 2 days before the race I was able to get 2 nights of 8 hours proper and feel good. We spend 1.5 days in Oslo where I did a 2 mile shakeout run, then after arriving in Tromso Friday AM I did a quick 1.5 mile run there as well with a local run club.\n\nAs this again was a night time race (yet in the sunlight) starting at 830PM, I was a little lost at first of how to handle logistics. I wanted to make sure I was properly fueled, but not too full so I came up with this idea: Day of the race, have a big breakfast, moderate size pasta lunch, then a snack later in the day. I didn't want to have a big dinner right before and be too full or risk GI issues during the race. I also tried to hydrate throughout the day with a few nuun tablets, stay off my feet as much as possible and try to have a quick nap. Thankfully I got good night sleep the day before and slept in a bit, followed by an epic breakfast buffet at hour hotel (European breakfast buffets FTW!)\n\nWe met up with our friends for some pastries and coffee an hour after that and then rested for a few hours. I had a nice pasta dish for lunch around 2pm with some bread and my 2nd nuun tablet/water there. Following lunch we went back to the hotel and I tried to take a quick nap and get some rest in. The pre-race nerves started kicking in and I couldn't nap so I started getting my race clothes ready and gels/bib in order. About 6pm I ate a banana and some leftover pastries which were nice and stretched for about 30 minutes.\n\nThis is where I can really appreciate morning races because from here, I still had an hour and a half until start time with not much to do. My stomach was starting to act up due to nerves so had to deal with that as well and try to rehydrate a bit. For gels I had 6 Gu Roctane's with me for the race. 3 with caffeine (strawberry kiwi) and 3 without (lemonade). These are the same ones and amount I used on my first marathon and it worked out super well for me. I use the same on half races (2 instead of 6) and also trained with these on my long runs too so my body was well ready for them.\n\nLuckily, the start line was about 500ft from our hotel so I didn't have to stress about getting there at all. About 30 minutes prior to start time I got dressed, put some vaseline on the bits and armpits, had a bit more water and went down to stretch and get lined up.\n\nThe weather was a bit of a toss up too for me as it was forecast to be between 44F and 51F during the race and humid. Typically, i'll wear just lined shorts and a tank top but I was between that and a heavier t-shirt due to the wind/temps. I ended up going with the tank which I later regretted, but for the most part worked out. I did a quick jog around the block to get the legs warmed up and some final stretches then got situated for the start. There were no starting groups, just markers for finish times so I got near the 345-4h marker.\n\n# Race\n\nLined up for the start I was feeling good, temperatures were nice in the high 40s, felt ready to attack the course at sea level. The start line was next to the local cruise port so as the countdown hit 1, the cruise ship docked blasted its horn which was a nice little touch. The first mile goes through downtown Tromso with loads of people lined on the streets, then immediately turns to go up and over the famous\u00a0[Tromso bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8_Bridge). It's not a ton of incline but still right at the start I was aiming to go intentionally slower then blast down it to continue on course at my planned pace.\n\nMy planned pace for the race was around 8min50s miles and trying to start out a little slower than that due to the incline. My first few splits ended up being 8:49 (+127ft gain), 7:56 (-133ft), followed by \\~8m30s miles until mile 17. My heart rate was in a really good place too so I decided not to modify things and push on at this pace despite being a bit faster than I wanted. The elevation outside of the bridge was pretty steady and the temperatures remained great from what I could feel. My watch pace alerts were yelling at me, but I pushed through and surprised myself with how easy the miles were coming and going.\n\nThe first slight issue I had was that after maybe mile 3 or so I was getting hungry and realizing I should have possibly eaten a little more. From past experiences I know its better to get ahead of hunger on course so I took my first gel around 25 minutes into the race vs the 40 minute mark which I planned. This kind of threw me off schedule with the gel and I got in my head about this. My hunger eventually went away, but the aid stations with water were at odd intervals (or so it felt) so it became difficult to manage the timing with those. I eventually was able to turn off my pace alerts that were interrupting my music which was good.\n\nThe 2nd issue faced was my big toe on my right foot catching the front of my shoe in a weird way. These were my Altra Vanish Carbon race shoes which I've wore for a half marathon and about 15 miles or so otherwise of training so they were well broken in. The socks I was wearing I had worn before too so this was something totally new and unexpected. Managed to push through but it was pretty painful the last 10 miles or so and here I am 9 days later with a black toenail which will surely come off.\n\nThe course was absolutely gorgeous. I probably lost a few minutes fiddling with my phone to take photos and videos but i'm glad I did. It was so surreal running through the nordic countryside with stunning views of mountains and the water everywhere. There were also tons of locals outside their houses and flats with Norway flags, bonfires going, and people passing out beers and shots.\n\nThankfully once I was on course my body didn't really register what time it was at all and I was locked in on the race. After hitting the half marathon marker and seeing I was at 1hour 50 and getting a PR there, I knew that sub 4 or better was definitely possible. I tried to let off the gas a little bit as I knew it would be tougher towards the end as it was during my first marathon. With some elevation in favor, I continued around the 8m30s pace until mile 17 or so then as I returned to cross the bridge again I pulled back to 9m+ miles for the remaining.\n\nMile 20, like in my first marathon, was again a big struggle moment knowing I still had another 6 to go. I passed some of our friends watching which gave me some temporary energy but it was quickly gone as fatigue set in, the toe pain got worse, and the gels started to not settle well. It's hard to remember exactly, but I took my last caffeine gel around mile 20 and it seemed to sit in my upper chest and not really go down. This is something I've not really had happen ever during a race or training so I was lost on what to do. I walked the 2nd to last aid station to try and get it down but it still wasn't quite right. Feeling weak and knowing I was slowing, I tried the last gel at mile 23 and the last aid station and that one too didn't go down well. I ended up not finishing the gel and throwing some sports mix on top to push it down which didn't work either.\n\nMy last 3 miles were \\~10min10seconds and very painful. I was genuinely trying to just keep my feet moving and not puke on the side of the course. I slowly got into downtown where the finish was and felt worse and worse. I saw my wife and friends near the finish cheering me on as I passed through the finish line and stopped my watch. I was briefly so stoked about my time but I immediately felt terrible as the endorphins died off.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI slowly collected my medal, extra ripe banana and cold bottle of water and tried to find a place to sit down. I drank the cold water trying to catch my breath and decide if I was going to puke or not while my friends and wife came to congratulate me. At this point, my body started to drop in temperature as it was close to 40f now and I was in wet shorts and a tank from the sweat. I sat there for 5 minutes as my buddy got me a cup of warm water from a nearby store which helped a lot. I was dizzy, nauseous, freezing and wet. I questioned if I pushed too hard or was just dressed poorly and didn't eat enough, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nWe took a few photos, hobbled back to the hotel where I ultimately puked up the last 2 gels and a lot of water. I've never puked after any running event or physical event for that matter so that was new to me. Immediately my stomach felt better thankfully and I was able to get down my tailwind recovery drink with some bread and take a hot shower. At that point, the stoke came back and I couldn't stop smiling that I smashed my goal of finishing sub 4 and all the hard work paid off.\n\nAll in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this event to anyone who can make it up to Tromso. It's by far one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to and the event was great from start to finish. The training block I did was a huge success and I am super thrilled with the result and hitting personal bests in almost all categories for me. I told myself after the first marathon I wasn't sure if i'd do another, but after this one I'm almost certain I've got more in me.",

    "selftext": "Hello, I\u2019m relatively new to running, but my big toe nails, specifically ONLY on the INNER side of the big toe nail (next to 2nd toe) are getting purple and very painful. I\u2019d estimate about 1/3 of the nail is turning purple, area closest to 2nd toe. It happens on both feet.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to solve this issue for months and can\u2019t find any discussions of someone having this specific issue. I\u2019ve tried 3 different sizes of shoes, tons of socks, but it\u2019ll still happen even after a 5-6 mile run. I have other foot issues too like blisters but recently found some relief from Balega Blister resist. Thicker sock seems to help way better than the thin feetures. I\u2019ve also tried different shoe brands and Hokas have been the best, although I\u2019m open to trying something new again if needed.\n\nI tried the heel lock method but that made my heel hurt because it was so tight. I am almost 100% confident this issue is not caused by my toes hitting the front of the shoe because otherwise it would be the whole nail, or at least the front. Anybody have a clue what\u2019s going on? I keep my toe nails very trim, and I don\u2019t have this issue on any other toes whatsoever.\n\nI\u2019ve been contemplating trying the silicon toe caps. Would this have something to do with insoles? Why is this happening only after a few miles? It\u2019s stopping me from progressing in distance. I\u2019d upload a photo but it doesn\u2019t let me\u2026 Any help of feedback is appreciated, thank you!",

    "selftext": "**tl;dr: any suggestions for a lightweight breathable sun shirt or jacket that has a pocket for an iPhone 14 Pro, that I can wear while running in hot/sunny conditions (\\~25-35C/80s-90sF)?**\n\nHello,\n\nI'm looking for a jacket or sun shirt that I can wear while running when it's really hot and sunny. I'm trying to decrease my sunscreen usage. I would like to wear only a sports bra under the jacket or shirt on these hot days.\n\n**Desired features:**\n\n\\- weight: 110g or less  \n\\- hood  \n\\- sleeves I can pull over my hands (thumb loop is nice but not required - I'll just pull the sleeves all the way down)  \n\\- pocket that fits iPhone 14 Pro or something similarly sized, and which won't wildly bounce around (my usual running pants don't have pockets)  \n\\- high albedo, I want protection from UV exposure  \n\\- breathable  \n\\- I figure I'm going to be a sweaty mess if the temp is high, so it's okay if sweat builds up inside and stays on me (the fabric contributes to humidity)\n\n**I've tried on:**\n\n\\- [Dooy Sun Protection Jacket](https://www.amazon.com/Dooy-Cycling-Protection-Windbreaker-Windproof/dp/B07ZM8NWCH) in white and gray colors - I looked like I was wearing a trash bag.  \n\\- [Patagonia Airshed Pro Pullover](https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-airshed-pro-running-windbreaker-pullover/24197.html) in Wispy Green color - It worked well enough, and I like that it can zip over my mouth (more sun protection coverage). However, the one annoyance is that the chest pocket is so roomy that when I zip the bottom chest zipper up (to allow for airflow), my phone flops around wildly (it still flops around a lot when I have the chest zipped fully shut). Also, not sure the fabric actually protects me from the sun?  \n\\- [Arcteryx Incendo Airshell Hoody](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/incendo-airshell-hoody) in Arctic Silk color - This had more airflow than the Patagonia Airshed because it was looser in the torso. Hand pockets held my phone pretty well. Not sure if it actually protects me from the sun? Anyway, no huge complaints with this jacket, but it's $240. If I can't find anything else that checks off all the above boxes, then I guess I have to wear a $240 jacket. I'd be so worried that I'd rip a hole in a $240 jacket (the fabric is \"lightweight nylon ripstop with DWR finish provides light weather resistance / Double weave textile for all day comfort and durability / Clean finished seams\"). On the other hand, what is skin protection worth to me? A lot.\n\n**I haven't ordered/tried on but have looked at:**\n\n[Black Diamond Distance Wind Shell](https://blackdiamondequipment.com/products/w-distance-wind-shell) \\- This seems sort of similar to the Arcteryx. I confirmed that the pocket fits my phone. The Glacier color (teal) probably has higher albedo than the Blue Ash color (gray).  \n[Nathan Stealth Jacket 2.0](https://nathansports.com/products/womens-stealth-jacket-2-0?variant=40623032270936) \\- I confirmed this pocket does not fit my phone.  \n[Salomon Sense Aero Wind](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/sense-aero-wind-lc12979.html) \\- I confirmed this pocket does not fit my phone.  \n[Janji Sunchaser 50 Hooded Long Sleeve](https://janji.com/products/ws-sunchaser-50-hooded-long-sleeve) \\- This lacks a pocket and it weighs 150g. But reviews say it's great for running in the sun. But I really would like a pocket so I don't have to carry my phone in my hand the whole time.\n\nThank you so much for any insight you can share.",

In my most recent 10k, I was holding 6:35/mi pace in the first 5k but wanted to hit 6:15/6:20 in the last 5k to negative split (trying to get under sub 40).  All my training suggests I can do it (I've been doing a lot of threshold 1km repeats at 6:10-6:20 and felt fine), but was really struggling to get my legs under me for the race.  It didn't feel easy trying to hit those faster paces in the back half, and didn't really even come close.  Ended with 40:30 finish time.  HR and breathing was fine, it was just finding the stride to up the pace.  Should I just start hard and try to carry it through the whole race?

That seemed perfect. I was scrolling through a list of races 7-9 weeks in the future, trying to lift my sprits after cancelling everything for Boston 2025. \n\nIn 2022 the Manitoba Marathon was my first attempt at the distance. I went into it with big goals \u2013 sub 3 and BQ \u2013 my pair of trusty Nike Pegasus and no idea what I was doing. As it turns out my lack of preparation somehow wasn\u2019t what doomed me, as the race was stopped after about 90 minutes due to extreme heat. I would go on to finish the course, but the timing equipment had been turned off and I received no official time and was listed as a DNF. That felt harsh.\n \nThree years later with maybe slightly more of a clue about running and even bigger goals it seemed like good symmetry. Or at least a good story. \n\n### Training\nI registered 9 weeks before the race. Boston was scuttled because a significant issue with my IT band and quad. Disappointing as it was to miss that race, I wasn\u2019t willing to the risk of not addressing it early and, with the injury hitting right at the start of my taper, I thought I had the opportunity to salvage my fitness. Recovery, with support from a physio, left me 6 weeks to execute a mini build and taper for Winnipeg.\n\nMy plan was focused on sharpening my existing fitness and staying healthy enough to give a good effort on race day. I wanted to hit some key workouts to gauge my progress along the way both in terms of fitness and how my body was holding up: \nWeek 1: 20 miler with 15mi easy and 5 at MP\nWeek 2: Half-Marathon race a little faster than MP\nWeek 3: 20 mile LR workout feature 6x1mi repeats at threshold\nWeek 4: Half-Marathon race at HMP\n\nThe two half-marathon races were already on my calendar, so I\u2019m not sure if they were ideal but they were fun races that I didn\u2019t want to miss out on. I had physio session at the end of each week to make sure I was still on track and otherwise just ran based on how I felt. After the end of week 4 I went into my taper, with only a little more tempo work before the race. My last proper workout was 10 days out.\n\n### Pre-Race\nI flew out to Winnipeg on the Friday, two days before the race, with my Wife and Mother In-law who came out to visit some family and visit around Winnipeg for the weekend. In the past I\u2019ve maybe been guilty of overdoing it in the days before a race, so I mostly spent the warm afternoons inside and off my feet. Friday and Saturday I ran an easy 5kms with a few strides on Saturday and got a few walks in, but otherwise rested. \n\nSunday \u2013 race day \u2013 I woke up shortly after 4am to for some coffee and breakfast. I\u2019m apparently slow to digest so even with just a piece of toast, jam and banana the early start was normal and necessary. I sipped on some Maurten caf 320 on the drive down to the start. \n\nI arrived with about 1:20 minutes before the start. To help manage my ITBS I had a lengthy warmup and stretching routine to go through. Somehow that took even longer than expected, and by the time I had my race shoes tied up and gels tucked away I could hear \u2018O Canada\u2019 being performed at the starting line. \n\nNormally I\u2019m pathologically early to the point of comedy, so feeling late was uncomfortable. I jogged up to the start corral with few minutes to spare to realize that I had no idea how to get in. In the distance I could vaguely see a point where people were entering but it was far back and I\u2019m not one to try and push my back up to my assigned corral. A runner in front of me was in the same predicament and recruited some help to hop the barrier. I grit my teeth and followed him over \u2013 without help \u2013 clambering over the short steel fence without much dignity and landing way to hard on my Endorphin Elite 2s, \u201cbottoming out\u201d the soft foam. Shoes not necessarily made for jumping \u2013 noted. \n\n### Race\nThe race went off and after reassuring myself that I hadn\u2019t wrecked my shoes I was eager to settle into an early rhythm, aiming for even splits on the flat course. About 150 meters in I heard something clatter to the ground nearby, turned and realized one of my Caf 100s had fallen from my pocket. Not ideal for my nutrition plan but also painfully expensive, especially since the Caf 100s aren\u2019t available in Canada. I buried my second one further in the pocket, an action I\u2019d forget 25km later when I reached for it, couldn\u2019t find it, and assumed I lost that one too. \n\nEarly on I tucked in with a pack of five including a local runner - the greetings and cheers he exchanged with spectators gave me away - a youngster clearly running well slower than his fitness, two running much faster than their fitness, and myself. \nSomewhere around the 5km mark we were set to make a turn onto one of the large boulevards with a traffic lane coned off for runners. Only this lane hadn\u2019t be closed yet. A police officer directed us onto the sidewalk, calling unhelpfully from behind, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, they are closing it now.\u201d  \n\nI could only laugh at the symmetry between this and the 2022 race when we had also initially been directed onto the sidewalk after the race was cancelled. After about 1km we rejoined a now closed road.\n\nA large deer crossed our path as we entered Assiniboine Park, and we briefly became a pack of 7 when we picked up a runner who\u2019d fallen off the lead pack and a spectator started running beside us while clapping and (hopefully) cheering in a language I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nOn the other end of the park, I dropped back a little when the young fast runner sped up and the others attempted to follow. The runner who had dropped from the lead pack fell back next, followed by another who had be labouring for some time. We passed 25km and I started to feel tightness in my right quad. That was supposed to be my good side, but it didn\u2019t seem too serious yet. I was sure I could make it to 32km and then I\u2019d see what I had left. \n\nThe young fast runner was long gone and so was the pack of five. The local was still about 20 meters ahead but the others were out of site behind before 30km. At 32km the local fell back to me. I checked my time and decided, since quad hadn\u2019t gotten any worse, to make a short push. During my last marathon (Marine Corps 2025) I\u2019d gone through 32km feeling very strong but faded badly over the last 5. I was resolved to hold my pace as best I could this time. \n\nI can\u2019t remember exactly when it started but a patchwork of runners from other distances began populating the course. A 5k, 10k and Half-Marathon were being run at the same time, and now that I was nearing the finish I\u2019d be running through the slower parts of those races. In the cancelled 2022 race the only other runners I remember over the last few kilometers were faster marathoners who\u2019d burned themselves out in the heat and were now walking in. This time around I weaved, dipped and ducked through the thicker crowds and narrowing course. I became more frustrated in my desperation to maintain what momentum I could and worried about also running an 8-year-old down from behind. At 40km I ran into a woman who abruptly stepped in front of me to give a spectator a high-five.\n\nThe race finishes at the University/CFL stadium. Having picked my way through the crowd I made a right hand turn into the finishing chute that led into the stadium and onto the field. Instinctively I followed the runners ahead onto the left-hand side of the coned-off chute, wondering the whole time who thought it was a good idea to make me run through this mass of humanity.\n\n I stepped across the line, veered towards a volunteer who handed me a medal, doubled over and stopped my watch. The clock when I finished read 2:39 and change, but that I was for the half-marathon. Did it start 5 minutes later? I checked my watch. 2:44:45. Under the goal.\n\n### Post-race\nAll my previous marathons have had distinct moments that live clear as day in my memory. At L.A it\u2019s watching the mass of runners charge down the street from the top of Vin Scully Ave, at Erie 2 it\u2019s the Banana Man who I had to pull back onto the timing mat, and  at Boston 2024 it\u2019s dying on the crest of heartbreak and the kind woman who told me not to give up when she saw me about to stop and walk. What I hope to remember from this race is the image of my wife cutting through the crowd to get to me.\n\n \u201cYou did it!\u201d, she said, her eyes shining with sympathetic joy. \n\nI asked if she knew my chip tip. 2:44:25. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s under your goal,\u201d she reminded me, \u201cand I bet you would have been faster if you\u2019d gone down the marathon finish on the right-hand side, dummy.\u201d \n\nA fitting mistake and another opportunity to be grateful. This was a good day.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n",

I got so fixated on improving in something that I was finally passionate about, after being a hobby hopper all my life! I knew it\u2019d be a challenge, especially for how slow I am running, but I knew my body could recover pretty well. I got lucky with the weather for the most part and felt good all throughout my training! I had to decrease the mileage on some weeks but still ran an average of 40 miles/week, never missed a day except when sick, ran 3 20 milers and my last 20 miler, i did 5 miles, then 10 miles at goal marathon pace (9:09), followed by 5 miles. I felt good! Garmin was predicting a 3:57, and I knew garmin was pretty accurate for me based on my last race. However for like the week leading up to the race, I was so nervous! I\u2019ve never thought about myself as a nervous person before\u2026but i was getting worse quality sleep and stomachaches. First lesson learned, I shouldn\u2019t have had a pace goal for my first marathon!!\n\n\nPre-race\n\nI didn\u2019t run at all the week before the marathon, just because i was kind of feeling burnt out from running, and I wanted to be extra fresh for race day! I probably would\u2019ve ran if it wasn\u2019t for the heat wave in the twin cities right now\u2026\nI got 6 hours of sleep and woke up to the race being delayed 30 minutes. At this point I just wanted to survive and have fun, so I adjusted my goal time to 4:10 based on a heat-training calculator. Oh yeah\u2026this race was hotttt! It fluctuated a lot but the last 6 miles of the race were in the low to mid 80s. \n\nRace\n\nSo one thing about me is\u2026I\u2019ve never done well in the heat, I almost never go a day without sweating even in the winter. So I\u2019ve been getting up at like 5am for the past month to run, and so far I haven\u2019t had to run in temps over 75 and most were under 60 (all the long runs were cool too). That\u2019s just how I like it and how I will actually enjoy running, because otherwise what\u2019s the point! I guess it\u2019ll never be perfect though, because if I do a summer marathon then my training will be ideal, but then the marathon might be really hot and vice versa for a fall marathon. I guess a winter marathon would be ideal, but they don\u2019t really exist in Minnesota lol. Anyway, first mile and BAM 185 heart rate at a 9:19 pace and my garmin says i\u2019m at a -6 performance readiness and I\u2019m drenched in sweat. I also have to pee bc i\u2019ve been downing water at the start line and the lines for the portas were so long, so I only got to go like an hour before the race started. It also just feels\u2026weird to be running but I figured I was just warming up.\n9:30 pace was feeling comfortably hard, despite my HR averaging in the high 180s (max is around 202). Lesson 2, I just need to buy shokz man\u2026my beats headphones kept slipping from all the sweat which wasn\u2019t really a problem before. I took gels every 3 miles and water at basically every aid station. Around mile 16 was when it got a lot harder to hold the 9:30s so I\u2019m like ok that\u2019s way earlier than I would fatigue on my long runs but that\u2019s chill, I\u2019ll do 10:30s. There was a moderate hill at around mile 21, I was able to slowly run up it, then run the downhill that followed but after that it got sooo much harder! This was also when it got a lot hotter because we weren\u2019t getting the wind off lake superior anymore. My hamstrings probably hurt the most, my upper back and stomach too. Before, I would briefly walk through the aid stations but now I was walking through the entirety of the aid stations and at other parts too. I\u2019ve never felt that much fatigue from running it\u2019s crazy! I thought Id feel that as I was booking it to the finish line but nope\u2026those 11:30s got handsssss. This was so different from the half marathons I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve always had something left in me to do a fast last 5k and mile and sprint to the finish, but this one I had nothing left in me! I thought maybe there was some kind of mental barrier since I could sprint finish before, so I tried to pick it up at mile 25 because if I finished the last two miles in under 20 minutes I could maybe break 4:30 but nope, that wasn\u2019t happening either. At this point I was a bit confused about how my body was feeling and just because of how far off my time was going to be, even though I quit looking at my watch a while ago. All the volunteers and cheerers were amazing though it was so wholesome! I loved the live music, dancers, and some people I didn\u2019t even know looked at me and cheered my name! In any other scenario I\u2019d be creeped out but I was just so happy at that point. One thing that I was glad I did was take out my headphones once I got to duluth because it was so fun! My heart goes out to the people experiencing dehydration or other medical problems, as there were quite a few, I hope you\u2019re ok!\n\nPost-race: My hamstrings are so sore! But otherwise I\u2019m very happy I did it. I\u2019m a marathoner!! One thing I was struggling with afterwards was the slight disappointment of training at specific paces and running on average 8 hours a week+2/3 hrs of cross training (with a few 10 hour weeks too) and not even being close to my goal. Im so used to setting goals, that\u2019s how I motivate myself to do anything. But with a marathon, especially a first one, just showing up and doing the best you can is enough. I know one hard race doesn\u2019t negate all the work I did, but idk it\u2019s hard not to think about it like that. I just have to remind myself how lucky I am that I get to do this. Also comparing time trained to race time is just a recipe for bitterness and jealousy, definitely still need to work on that i\u2019ll admit it. I guess that was lesson 3 and 4?\nAnyway, thanks for reading, my whole running journey is basically on my reddit page, and to anyone who raced Grandma\u2019s today: you\u2019re all so strong fr.",

    "selftext": "I want to share my experience of staying in running shape while pregnant so hopefully other pregnant runners can see that you don't have to give up on running! Disclaimer: you should always check with your OB-GYN wether running is an appropriate form of exercise for you and take it easy postpartum until you are cleared to exercise again.\n\nRunning shape before I got pregnant: ran between 1-3 times every week for years, participating in one half marathon race every spring for the past 10 years, best half marathon time is 2 hours 3 minutes, worst is 2 hours 17 minutes. I'd call myself a consistent but slow runner.\n\nAdjustments while I was pregnant to keep running:\n\n1. No morning runs before breakfast. This was a big adjustment for me, since I usually trained early in the morning. But having low blood sugar while exercising when you're pregnant is not fun (it makes morning sickness symptoms worse) and not a strain you want to put on your body.\n2. Invest in a good quality maternity belt. Think of it like a sports bra for your growing belly. It reduces the discomfort of your belly bouncing up and down on your bladder and pulling on your muscles and ligaments.\n3. Don't exceed 140 bpm heart rate. This was the recommended max heart rate from my OB Gyn, I used a smart watch to track my heart rate. Most of the time I did not have the energy to push myself harder than that rate anyways, the only exceptions were running up hill and running at a higher altitude.\n4. Find a different way to stay fit once running is no longer an option. At 7 months I had to throw in the towel because running went from uncomfortable to painful. I am lucky enough to have easy access to a pool, so I started swimming 30 minutes every day instead. This was amazing for two reasons: I stayed fit so I had the energy to go through labor (which they say is the equivalent of running a marathon) and I got all the happy effects of swimming (getting my heart rate up, feeling weightless, cooling down).\n\nActions I took postpartum:\n\n1. Walk every day until cleared for other exercise. The first six weeks are very limited in what's allowed, I was advised to only go for walks and slowly increase the distance I walked, which is what I did. I started with walks around the block and slowly increased them to walking for an hour or two each day with the baby in the stroller. Also a great way to get indirect sunlight for the baby to help them overcome their jaundice.\n2. Buy myself a new pair of running shoes with extra cushioning. I gained 40 lbs when pregnant and quickly lost about 25 lbs in the first few weeks postpartum. That still puts me at 15 lbs over my pre pregnancy weight and the extra cushioning helps my knees and ankles feel better. I also treated myself to a new pair of walking shoes to make my daily walks more comfy as well. Definitely worth the investment.\n3. Buy myself new running shorts that fit comfortably for my new body. I might lose the weight I gained, but the best way to do that is by exercising and I feel more motivated when my clothes fit well and are not too tight. Worth spending a couple of dollars on shorts I will wear constantly for the next couple of months.\n4. Stretch stretch stretch. Constant walking made my glutes and upper thigh muscles pretty tight, which is not good for my lower back. Doing a daily yoga routine of cat cow, reverse pigeon and supine twists really helped my back. I also pay more attention to the position of my pelvis and the tightening of my abs when walking and running to prevent myself from training with a hollow back (9 months of having a belly pull your spine forward requires some active focus to get your posture back).\n\nThe result: I went for a run the day I was cleared for exercise at six weeks postpartum. It was amazing. I ran for 30 minutes straight at 10:30 per mile. I felt like I was flying around the trail and I was so happy to be able to run again I kept taking little sprints. Afterwards I felt great. The next day I was a bit stiff and my next run was significantly slower at 11:30 per mile. Since I've been cleared I've ran roughly every other day and I'm fairly confident I'll be able to run a half marathon in fall.\n\n",

    "title": "Brol\u00f8bet: the bridge run (half marathon)",
    "selftext": "\u201cRun across the bridge.\u201d That was the pitch for this unusual run, the bridge in this case being the \u00d8resund Bridge between Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden, on the 25th anniversary of its official dedication in summer 2000. This was the third such run, the first having 79,719 finishers on 12 June 2000, still the world\u2019s largest half marathon; and the second with around 30,000 runners in June 2010.\n\nSomeone in our running club mentioned it early in 2024. The first adventure was signing up; tickets went on sale on 1st February 2024 and sold out 40,000 tickets in a few hours, with the web site barely functioning under the load. Nevertheless a dozen of us signed up; and 18 months later arrived in Copenhagen, city of parks and bicycles, ready to run.\n\nThe run was organized by two running clubs, Sparta Atletik in Denmark and MAI (Malm\u00f6 Allm\u00e4nna Idrottsf\u00f6rening) in Sweden. There were expos in both countries, with the Copenhagen one conveniently positioned by F\u00e6lledparken parkrun where some of us ran on the Saturday before the race. Bib pickup was as the expo, which was fun with a nameboard showing all the runners, discounted shoes and other goodies. Along with the bib, runners were given a handy folding bag which was required for bag drop.\nI had not trained specifically for this run, taking the view that I would still be fit enough following Manchester Marathon at the end of April. In fact my fitness has dropped a bit but not disastrously so. I had signed up for the 1:30 \u2013 1:40 wave and was nervous about completing it in the time but figured this race was more about the experience than chasing a PB (personal best). This put me in the third wave (yellow), starting at 9:50, though bag was to be dropped by 8:45.\n\nBeing a get-there-early sort of person, I arrived around 8:00am at which time it was easy to use the facilities and have a wander round; not much to see other than the gathering runners and a stand from sponsor Boozt. Weather was sunny and we had been warned of a warm race so slathered myself with suncream and did my best to hydrate. Organization until this point had been fine but there were a few issues in the start area; not enough portaloos was the biggest problem.\n\nWe left the pen shortly after 9:50 as planned. This was not the start though; we were walked around some roads and waited a bit, so Garmin tells me the actual start was 10:26. The course ran through Kastrup and then down into the tunnel that precedes the bridge. It was warm until we entered the tunnel, then nice running conditions in the shade of the tunnel, busy with runners but not too congested. My first miles were the fastest, then it was a gentle uphill out of the tunnel and towards the bridge. As we emerged from the tunnel there was a noticeable headwind but the sky was overcast and it was not as warm as expected, phew!\n\nBy the time we got onto the bridge proper it was about half way through the race. Plenty of water stations with drinks in cardboard cartons; quite good for holding though I am not good at drinking much while running. The course did not allow for much in the way of spectators though stationary traffic on the other half of the bridge gave us some honks and cheers.\n\nThe nature of the course is that you have a long gentle climb until you reach the centre of the bridge, and then a long gentle downhill to the finish. I should have been able to speed up more than I did, but not being in peak condition I continued at just over 7:30 mile pace. Coming into Sweden and off the bridge there were spectators and some nice crowd support. Then into the park, past a sign that said \u201c200m to shine\u201d, and a little kick at the end to finish on 1:39:34, just within my start wave prediction, 2895 of 40230 runners, and 6th of 340 in my age group VM65.\n\nThe finish area at this point was busy but not too crowded. I received my medal and banana, got a free \u201cselfie\u201d from a Boozt stand, and wandered through the finish field looking for the bag trucks which turned out to be at the far end. Then I returned to the finish in search of friends and family.\n\nOh dear! I am not sure exactly when things started to go wrong, but the runners finishing at what should have been just under two hours, and later, were not able to run over the line because of congestion. They were forced to walk to the finish, with some complaining of 10-15 minutes wait; frustrating for those aiming to beat 2 hours. The reason was that the immediate finish area was not being cleared of runners fast enough; I remember from Manchester (a mere 30,000 runners) that this needs to be done quite aggressively by marshals otherwise you get exactly this problem.\nThe situation was worse because there was no segregation in the finish area between runners and general spectators so it was hard to move through the crowd. There should have been a sizeable runner-only area at the finish allowing a clear space to move into after completion.\n\nAnother common complaint was lack of signage, particularly to the bag collection area. Bag collection was fine for me; I was served by the same person who picked up my bag first thing in the morning. Later on though things fell apart; the trucks were apparently out of numerical order, bags were strewn around, spectators were allowed into the bag collection area and some thefts were reported.\n\nWorse still was the transport away from the finish. There were coaches both back to Copenhagen, or to the nearest train station at Hyllie. There were no organized queues but lines formed, though with no real clarity as to which line was for which coach, and some ignoring the lines and heading straight for the road side. There were not enough coaches, and it began to be whispered that a collision on the bridge had delayed the Copenhagen coaches. Mobile internet or even voice calls barely worked so communication was poor.\n\nMany of us took what seemed to be the least bad option, a 5KM walk to Hyllie, despite a friend messaging \u201cdon\u2019t come to Hyllie\u201d because of overcrowded platforms and lack of sufficient trains. For us, once we got to Hyllie all was well and we stepped straight onto a train to Copenhagen and even got seats.\n\nThis was not good though and many of the problems seemed to be avoidable, particularly the organization of the finish area, lack of finish area marshals, lack of communication, and shortage of food and water during the long enforced wait for transport.\n\nOf course all these problems soon fade from memory; it was a fantastic run and an unforgettable experience. Nobody knows when or if there will be another bridge run and I am glad to have been part of it.\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 7:11\n| 2 | 7:08\n| 3 | 7:37\n| 4 | 7:14\n| 5 | 7:18\n| 6 | 7:28\n| 7 | 7:48\n| 8 | 8:05\n| 9 | 8:10\n| 10 | 7:38\n| 11 | 7:29\n| 12 | 7:33\n| 13 | 7:24\n| 14 | 7:03 (0.22 miles)",

    "selftext": "So, for context, 32M. Started running 2 years ago, stopped after 3 months. 1 year ago, stopped again after 4 months. Around February/March this year I restarted for the third time, and I\u2019m starting to enjoy it for once! Plan is to do a 5k race every 4-6 weeks to keep me motivated. However, what I\u2019m starting to realise is I\u2019m just feeling perpetually\u2026 underwhelmed? Disappointed? I don\u2019t know the right term. \n\nRegardless of how much I improve, I just can\u2019t feel happy about it. When I started back running in February, I was doing a 28 minute 5k. By my first race in May, I was down to 24:56. My PB from 2024 was 24:32, so I wasn\u2019t happy with that. I started training properly (intervals, etc. which I had never done) with the goal of going sub 24 by my next race in late June. I got 23:18, well under my target\u2026 and I was just disappointed I didn\u2019t get sub-23. Everyone was celebrating, people delighted going sub 30, sub 28 etc. and I was just there being like \u201cright, not good enough. Sub 22:30 by July race\u201d.\n\nSet a goal, beat it, be disappointed, set new goal.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle, and I just want to know is it typical? Do you ever feel content with your running?

I did one trail 22-miler about a month before the race, and I did a couple of hilly 15-16 milers on roads.  The race only had about 6k feet of vert over the 50 miles, so it actually wasn't insane.  I turned out to be pretty prepared with minimal training outside of a good marathon block--at no point in the race was my fitness a serious problem.  \n\n\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nMy husband drove me to the park (we live about an hour away), dropped me off with my stuff, and then went to a hotel where he would be spending the night in a moderately comfy bed while I ran around in the woods.  The race was set up as a loop of about 26 miles, which you run twice.  I had two drop bags.  One was at the start/finish area, which I passed at mile 26, and one was at the other main aid station, which I passed at miles 10, 13, 37, and 40.  I had a bunch of snacks in each bag, consisting of dried fruit, those little fruit pouch thingys that you give to toddlers, rice krispie treats, and super sour scandinavian swimmers (they're the trader joe's version of sour patch kids, they're amazing).  I also had a ton of electrolyte packs, although I ended up only using 4 of the 12 that I brought.\n\n\n\n\\### Race\n\nThe race was super well-organized, and it started just a few minutes after 6pm on Saturday.  It was pretty hot at the start, maybe low 80s and humid.  It got much cooler starting around 7:30.  The first 15 or so miles were super uneventful.  I hit the first aid station at mile 10, snarfed down a Reese's cup and some watermelon, ran the 3-mile loop and came back to the aid station and snarfed down another Reese's cup and some more watermelon, along with a couple of quesadilla wedges.  By this point the sun has gone down and I've pulled out my headlamp.\n\n\n\nAt mile 15, it starts to rain.  Torrential rain. My eyes kept stinging and my sweat rag was the only item of fabric on my person that did not have bug spray on it, so I kept using that to wipe my eyes.  My glasses had so much water on them that I couldn't see very well, and the rain was obscuring visibility as well.  Needless to say, this stretch of the race kind of sucked.\n\n\n\nIt was still raining when I rocked up to the start/finish/halfway point.  I had a full change of clothes (including socks, shoes, and underwear) in my drop bag there.  I decided to change despite the rain, on the grounds that for one brief, glorious moment, I would be dry.  As it happened, in the 7 minutes that it took me to change clothes, the rain stopped.  I have literally never been so happy in my \\*life\\* to see the weather clear up.  I hung out at the aid station for a few minutes, ate some boiled potatoes and another Reese's cup, refilled my snacks, and headed back out.  \n\n\n\nAround mile 28, I briefly got lost.  There was a stream crossing that I hadn't remembered (on rocks, no getting wet involved), and at 1am I could not for the life of me figure out where to go.  Some dude came up behind me when I'd been wandering around confused for about 5 minutes and showed me where to go.  He and I ran the entire rest of the race together, and the company was super nice.  We were moving at about the same pace, and having a little bit of conversation and navigational consulting was really really helpful.  \n\n\n\nWe hit the aid station again at mile 37.  Y'all, they had pierogis.  Hot, delicious, wonderful, magical portable potato pockets.  I had four.  Then we ran the lollipop bit, and I grabbed a couple more pierogis for the road at mile 40.  At this point, we were probably running half and walking about half.  I started getting blisters around mile 38, probably from the wet socks, and the blisters were consistently the limiting factor from there on out, rather than my fitness.  \n\n\n\nBy the watch, the race ended up being 53 miles.  I got exceedingly grouchy in the last 2 miles, because I was mentally prepared for 51.5-52 miles, but not for 53.  But we finished!  My running buddy was encouraging me and pulling me along for the last few miles, which I really appreciated.  I might have given up on making the cutoff without him.  \n\n\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI crossed the finish line, heard tons of people cheering, and then collapsed onto a bench at a picnic table.  I caught up with all the people I'd chatted with during the race to see how they'd all done.  All of them finished!!  Including two guys doing their first ultra.  Seemed like most people had a really good night, despite the rough conditions.  I ate a couple of pancakes, and my husband picked me up from the finish area.  \n\n\n\nHe took me back to the hotel he'd stayed at so that I could shower.  Guys, I don't remember the last time a shower felt that good.  I smelled like wet feet at the end of the race, and cleaning off all the mud/sweat/bugspray felt amazing.  I made him stop at Chipotle so that I could get a 10:30am burrito, then I napped on the way home.  I napped for another couple of hours once we got home, and felt surprisingly okay afterward!  \n\n\n\nThe only serious physical consequence is that my blisters alone should really qualify me for short-term disability.  I have 12 of them, mostly big ones.  One on the bottom of each toe, and one on each heel.  I have one on each foot that goes between my big toe and the next toe, so right where flip flops sit.  I intend to whine about them extensively until they heal, because whining about minor self-inflicted injuries always makes them heal faster.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, I'm feeling great!  I'm burning some sick leave today so that I don't have to go to work, but now I can stalk ultrasignup to find my next race :) \n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

I looked through old threads about the topic, but most discussions were based on outdated rules/policies as well as a completely different political environment.\n\nAge: 50-55\nGender: F (born male)\nPace, etc.: see below\n\nI\u2019m transgender (male to female), and although I\u2019ve been running for almost 4 decades I\u2019ve only recently run in my first 5k. It was a Pride race, so being trans was a non factor.\n\nBut now I want to enter more races, and I don\u2019t want to stir the pot or cause any controversy. Most runners I know are very inclusive and welcoming, but I know there are exceptions. Entering a race as a \u201cman\u201d when I\u2019m absolutely not would be traumatic enough that I would likely not run at all. So, do I enter as my correct gender and hope it doesn\u2019t become a big deal? Do I contact the race organizers each time? (a very uncomfortable conversation when I just want to run) Some considerations:\n\n-I do not \u201cpass\u201d very well at this point. If someone looks at me closely they can generally tell I\u2019m trans.\n\n-I have been transitioning for 2.5 years. My hormones have been in the correct range for a significant time, and my testosterone levels are actually lower than cisgender women.\n\n-I am not an elite runner by any stretch. My 10k PR is ~58 minutes and my 5k just under 27. The one half marathon I ran (by myself, not in a race) was over 3 hours.\n\n-I won\u2019t be entering any races where I might win any monetary or other tangible awards, so I wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctaking\u201d anything from cisgender runners.\n\nI\u2019m open to hearing conflicting opinions, but hopefully this can be civil.",

    "selftext": "I feel like it is a common joke among runners about how much we hate taking the time to do strength training or stretching. Personally, I have had so many false starts - I tell myself, \"this is the week\" and I maybe get through a half-hearted session or two, but then I just completely lose interest. It's so boring. It's so repetitive. And running is SO MUCH MORE FUN!\n\nAnd yet... I'm constantly getting annoying injuries. One months it's ITBS. The next it's PFPS. Next my hip starts hurting out of nowhere. I've managed to adjust my running and still complete a couple marathons over the last year, but these injuries are such a drag.\n\nSo I'm curious to hear - if you're someone who used to hate strength and stretching, but it's now a regular part of your routine, how'd you do it?! What changed? What enables you to be consistent? Was it finding the right plan (and please feel free to drop your plan in the comments!)? Was it seeing results? Was it something else?\n\nWould love to hear what worked for you in the hopes that I can finally, finally, finally achieve a more well-rounded routine. Thanks :)",

I didn\u2019t have the time or energy to commit to that level of training, and shorter distances seemed like the more practical path.\n\nSo this year, I set my sights on the 10K at the Calgary Marathon. My primary goal was to break 50 minutes. My stretch goal was a seemingly impossible sub-48:00; a time that felt a little out of reach. To put my fitness in context at the start of this block: my personal bests were 4:21 for a kilometre, 7:45 for a mile (4:49/km pace), 24:49 for 5K, and 52:50 for 10K. The idea of holding something close to my fastest mile pace for 10 kilometres felt borderline delusional. But if I pulled it off, I\u2019d be running at a pace I once thought was pure fantasy. And if I blew up? It would still make for one hell of a story.\n\nLife being what it is, family commitments meant I couldn\u2019t actually race at the event, but I decided to go through a full training block and time trial it anyway.\n\n### Training\nI used the new Garmin Run Coach for this training block. I had already spent about three months training under Garmin\u2019s Daily Suggested Workouts (without a race goal) and felt that I had built enough of a base to handle a more aggressive program.\n\nMy weekly mileage was modest\u2014the average hovered around a 30 km, with my peak week hitting only 45. On paper, this looks a little light, but it was quite demanding in practice. I was running five times a week: two easy runs, a long run, and two quality sessions (a rotation of tempo, threshold, VO2 Max, anaerobic, and sprint workouts). The overarching theme was low mileage, high intensity. Fortunately, with decent sleep and solid nutrition, I was able to handle the grind without falling apart.\n\nThat said, Garmin\u2019s Run Coach is a little quirky. The 15-week program was divided into Base, Build, Peak, and Taper phases \u2014 but instead of building progressively, my training load would drop at the start of each new phase before climbing again. It made for some head-scratching moments. For instance, my highest 7-day average load actually occurred at the end of the Base phase.\n\nI did catch a couple of colds and missed about a week of training twice, but even factoring that in, my training load felt suspiciously low for the goals I was chasing.\n\n### Time Trial\nWhen race day (or more accurately, _time trial day_) arrived, my confidence was not exactly overflowing. I debated between two options: either aim for a \"safe\" sub-50, or go for broke with the sub-48 attempt. Naturally, I picked the reckless one. \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained,\" I said to myself, knowing full well it could end in a spectacular blow-up.\n\nI had picked a flat, fast route (the pathway along the Bow River) to give myself the best shot. The temperature was crisp 4\u00b0C, and a helpful tailwind was an unexpected stroke of luck. I aimed for a slight positive split: start at 4:42/km, finish at 4:50/km, hanging on for dear life in the later stages.\n\nAfter a short warm-up, I took off. And immediately found myself at 4:35 pace. Rookie move! It took considerable discipline to rein it back. I knew from experience that the first few kilometres always feel suspiciously easy, but there\u2019s hell to pay on the way back.\n\nThe first 5 km unfolded exactly as planned. Steady pace, controlled effort. My original plan was to turn back at this point and head back to the start. Half a kilometre into the return trip, the breeze that was a tailwind earlier had turned into an bothersome headwind (_Shocker, I know!_). So I turned back again, and decided to take an Uber back to my car after finishing.\n\nThis is where things began to unravel. Fatigue hit, I started to run out of breath, and I had to take brief walk breaks nearly every kilometre. The stopping and starting slowed me down. I was a few seconds ahead at the halfway point  but started hemorrhaging seconds after 6 km. Kilometres 7 and 8 were absolute misery. A 30-second walk break at the 7 km mark pretty much torpedoed any shot at breaking 48 minutes. Thankfully, sub-49 was still within reach.\n\nI summoned whatever scraps of resolve I had left, pushed through to the finish, and crossed 10K in 48:30 \u2026 half a minute shy of my stretch goal.\n\n### Assessment\nDid I nail sub-48? No. Was I thrilled? Absolutely.\n\nAt the start of the year, breaking 50 minutes felt wildly optimistic. Running 48:30 -- and hitting PBs of 7:29 for the mile and 23:37 for 5K along the way -- made this a huge personal win.\n\nOnce the high wore off, I started dissecting what I could\u2019ve done better. The most obvious area was my training. The low mileage remained a consistent concern throughout the cycle, and I\u2019m fairly certain that adding more volume would\u2019ve helped me claw back those 30 seconds.\n\nNext, I turned to the race itself. Could I have paced it better? Maybe started a little slower and gone for a negative split? It\u2019s a tactic that has worked for me in a half marathon, but a 10K is a different beast. The intensity is higher, and it\u2019s less forgiving of mistakes.\n\nLastly, I wondered if I could\u2019ve just toughed it out -- pushed through the pain, skipped the walk breaks, and hung onto my goal pace. It\u2019s an easy thing to imagine in hindsight, but in the moment, it would\u2019ve been nearly impossible. The fact that I was forced to walk, not because my legs gave out, but because I was gasping for air, told me I was already operating close to my limit.\n\nThe more I thought about it though, the more I realized how many things _had_ gone my way that day. First, I had the luxury of choosing a nice, flat course, and revising it halfway through: not at all possible in a sanctioned race. Certainly not in Calgary, where the organizers love tossing in a few hills. I also ran exactly 10 kilometers as measured by my watch. In an official race, you always end up covering a little extra distance, and those final few hundred meters eat up valuable seconds. The weather too, was close to ideal: cold, with a helpful tailwind. And, for the first time, I was wearing supershoes (Endorphin Speed 4\u2019s). Had I run the Calgary Marathon 10K in my regular trainers, I doubt I would have gone under 49 minutes.\n\n### Closing Thoughts\nThe most meaningful takeaway has been realising how far I\u2019ve come. [Just two years ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/running/comments/13v8fhw/race_report_2023_calgary_marathon_10k/), the idea of running a 10K in under 55 minutes felt daunting. I remember looking at those numbers and thinking, \"_how do people even do that\"_? And now, here I am---finishing six minutes faster!\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just my race times that have improved; I have become much fitter as well. My VO2 Max has climbed from 46 to 51. My easy run pace, which used to hover around 7:30/km to 8:00/km, now sits between 6:15 and 6:30/km. I\u2019m leaner, stronger, and just generally in a better place than I ever was.\n\nIn the end, while there\u2019s always room to improve -- more mileage, smarter pacing, tougher mental game -- it feels like several stars aligned for me that day. And honestly, given where I started, this was probably the best result I could\u2019ve hoped for.\n\n_____\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n\n___\nEdit: I used ChatGPT to help proofread and polish this essay, and threw a curveball at it in the end.

    "selftext": "Race Report: Dexter-Ann Arbor Run (DXA2)\n\n### Race Information\n* **Name:** Dexter-Ann Arbor Run\n* **Date:** June 1, 2025\n* **Distance:** 6.2 miles (10K)\n* **Location:** Ann Arbor, MI\n* **Website:** https://dxa2.com/\n* **Time:** 42:19\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub-45 | *Yes* |\n| B | Top 5 Gender Finish | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 6:45\n| 2 | 6:48\n| 3 | 6:56\n| 4 | 6:37\n| 5 | 6:44\n| 6 | 6:49\n| 0.2 | 1:45\n\n### Training\nI must admit, I\u2019m guilty of being the half-marathoner who got a bit injured and switched to race the 10K a couple days pre-race. On Monday, my last strength session, I decided to do split squats after I hadn\u2019t in months (why?) I thought I was keeping them light, but I wasn\u2019t, and I tweaked my tibialis posterior when I overloaded my left leg. I thought it was fine\u2026until Tuesday morning.\n\nI had a pretty bad posterior tibial strain six months ago post-marathon, so I had an idea of how severe my issue was this time around. It certainly wasn\u2019t as bad, but the half marathon was not happening. So, 10K it is!\n\nTraining for this race was all half-marathon training since that was my original plan. My original goal was sub-1:45 for an April half marathon. I began training for this race in mid-February after running all easy + low-volume (0-20mpw) due to injury and illness for two months prior. (I used the elliptical to replace runs). I did Wednesday (total 11-12mi) and Saturday workouts (total 14-16mi) with longer intervals (1200m-2 miles) and easy 4mi runs or elliptical the other days of the week. I ran 30-45mpw. I got 01:37 on race day and I was thrilled.\n\n2 weeks after the April half, I went for a 5K PR (goal sub-22). I only did one workout for this race since it took awhile to recover from the half. I ran just under 20 on race day. For fun, I ran another half a week later and ran 01:46 with moderate effort. I fit a couple long run workouts in between that half and this past weekend\u2019s race but mostly just tried to hold fitness. \n\n### Pre-race\nI had pre-race jitters, so I got 5 hours of sleep the night before. Woke up bright and early and did my 3mi warm-up run to the start line. I always find it hilarious how slow my pre-race warm ups are. Cannot figure out how I go from slogging it at 10min pace to 7min pace. Then, I people-watched at the start line for 10min before the gun went off. \n\n### Race\n\n**Mile 1-2:** I went out at just above my half-marathon RPE. Never truly raced a 10K before but assumed this would be an appropriate effort level. I was near the front of the pack, so we got in our groups of 3-4 pretty quickly and broke away from the rest of the racers so it felt pretty empty. \n\n**Mile 3-4:** I was mostly feeling fine and settled in and kept my RPE steady. I was super excited to start watching the elites double back, and it was honestly pretty fun to double back myself and have people cheering me on, especially all of the women who were cheering on the top ladies. I remember being amazed by watching the fastest women speed back on the loop when I ran this race 3 years ago, and now being one of those women was super cool.\n\n**Mile 5:** This was the start of the last third, and I was beginning to get cooked pretty fast. The nausea was here and I knew if I didn\u2019t check myself I would indeed wreck myself. I slowed down a bit and felt better. \n\n**Mile 6-end:** I read on Reddit how it\u2019s okay to go into the pain cave the last 1-2K of a 10K, so I figured it was okay to just die starting now. The 1.2 miles is one big uphill which is the worst race design ever but I full-sent it up the whole way and found that it was my heart, not my legs, that was holding me back. I heard a woman yell \u201c42!\u201d when I was a bit away from the finish so I knew I wasn\u2019t making it sub-42 but I was happier it was over.\n\n### Post-race\nI walked back to my car with my family and we got halfway home (home is only 10 minutes drive) before I realized I had won a prize (3rd woman!) and we speed-walked back to the finish line tent and made it in time for the awards ceremony. I got my moment of local racer glory with my plaque and 50$ check \ud83d\ude02 and I\u2019m still feeling pretty chuffed about that. So, although my half marathon plans got cancelled, I\u2019m pretty happy. And\u2026my tibialis posterior feels better after the race???",

But it had to do.\n\nWorst still, I picked up a bad ankle injury thanks to a few selfish path users. This put paid to the idea of completing 50km, so I dropped to what was officially 22km.\n\n### Pre-race\nHaving arrived by overnight bus (15 hours!) from a Peruvian coastal city, I rested up in the Andean city of Chachapoyas (altitude 2,300m above sea level) and performed a few acclimatisation runs in the local area, before moving base to the town of Pedro Ruiz Gallo - within a tuk-tuk ride of the start line.\n\nThe people running the hotel were incredible. They went out of their way to get me to the kit collection the day before the race and the start line on the day of the race itself. They even waited for me and gave me a lift back to the hotel post-event, then prepared a special lunch for us all to share!\n\n### Race\nArriving in the very small town of Suyubamba, the  Peruvians were already in full party mood at 0630. We lined up and, surprisingly for Peru, actually start bang on time at 0700!\n\nThe first part of the race was along a gravel track with some minor undulations. Due to the training problems, I had already decided I was walking up all uphill sections and going steady on flats and downhills, but by the end of the track I had identified a big issue...\n\nThe track eventually became a trail, narrow in places but with almost non-stop climbing! Through farmland, mountainous trails and jungle we just kept climbing! I remember looking at my watch and wondering how the hell we were still climbing after 14km! I kept thinking \"it must go downhill soon!\" but was always surprised. In the end, we climbed over 1,200m.\n\nThe route involved 2 river crossing whilst climbing uphill, and took in 3 large waterfalls - including crossing the pool at the bottom of one and then not being able to get uphill through a small muddy section that followed!\n\nEventually we summited, and started our downhill descent on a wide but unpaved track. My legs were utterly shot, however, so the running was a little sporadic.\n\nWith just over 4km to go we went through the village of Cuispis and I finally felt like I might be able to run consistently - only to be met by 2km of a steep downhill trail section that was purely calf-deep mud. It was like ice! It's the wet season here now and that trail was determined to show it. The butterflies in this section were plentiful and stunning, but I could barely look at them as I was too busy trying to very slowly place my feet on the very few rocks that I could find within this quagmire.\n\nThe path levelled out with only a few hundred metres to go, and I was welcomed back to civilisation by the National Police, who were concerned about how many people were still out on a very tough course. I had to tell them not to take their motorbike up the section I had just come down as it would end up buried!\n\nA couple of turns later on the paved main road through the Amazon and I arrived back into Suyubamba to be greeted by a roaring cheer from all the other finishers and the finish line itself.\n\n### Post-race\nImmediately after crossing the line I fell to my knees with exhaustion - the terrain had taken its toll and was harsher than I had imagined it would be. The hotel owners rushed over, gave me my medal and a drink, and then I was mobbed by local Peruvian women all wanting a photo with the gringo (I was 1 of 4, but didn't know the others before the kit collection). That last part is fairly commonplace here - but they never send me the pics!\n\nThere was a little shop/stall selling banana cake and electrolyte drinks, which both went down a treat. The family that runs the hotel then gave me a ride back, kindly preparing a delicious lunch of beef, rice and yellow potatoes, with cooked bananas for desert and freshly picked tea, whilst we watched the Champions League final together.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph",

    "selftext": "I ran a marathon a month ago, hoping to run it under 3h 30min, but ended up doing it in 3h 49min. Looking back, given my weekly mileage of 37.5km, 3h 30min was probably overly optimistic, but I didn't know this at the time. I wanted to see if there was an easy way to estimate the required weekly mileage for a given marathon time.\n\nA recent [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386323276_The_Training_Intensity_Distribution_of_Marathon_Runners_Across_Performance_Levels) on strava runners addresses this very issue, but it's behind a paywall. Luckily, some of the [plots](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben-Hunter-2/publication/386323276/figure/fig1/AS:11431281390937984@1745305521595/Training-volume-expressed-as-mean-weekly-distance-km-for-athletes-with-different_W640.jpg) can be accessed.  I recreated the plot and fitted a trendline through it. You can see it [here](https://i.imgur.com/tdfGXE7.png). \n\nThe amount of weekly mileage in km you need is given by the formula 20 + (3010 / (time (in min) - 100)). So, in my case, I was off by roughly 10km/week to get the desired 3h 30min time. According to this model, running 3h 49min requires a weekly mileage of 43km, which is about 6km more than the distance I was averaging. So, I slightly overperformed the estimated time, but this is within margin of error.\n\n**EDIT: I was not the one who did the study. I simply took one of the graphs and did one interpretation of it. This study was published in sport medicine. If you have an issue with it, maybe contact the authors or the journal that accepted it.**\n\n**EDIT2: Why is everyone so angry? Please stop PMing me. Again, I am not the author of the paper. I am not the one that made the plot. All I did was fit a trendline and write an equation. Read the full paper if you want more details about how the data was obtained and what assumptions were made.**",

While the former remains my primary sport, my running has steadily increased since my first 5k in 2019 (Ottawa Race Weekend, 24:41). From 2019-24, I ran six 5ks (PB 21:29) and three 10ks (PB 44:46), plus one 10k DNS after getting COVID a week before 2022 Ottawa Race Weekend. For spring 2025, I set my sights on running my first half-marathon and doing so at a pace that was in-line with my 2024 5k and 10k results (sub-1:40).\n\n# Training\n\nFor my inaugural crack at the distance, I went back and forth between Higdon\u2019s Intermediate 2 plan and Pfitz 12/55 before ultimately deciding that the latter was a touch too aggressive for where my running volume was at. At the same time, I wanted a Half plan that also incorporated some amount of speedwork. Both for scheduling and load management, I made a couple of consistent changes to the plan:\n\n* Thursday\u2019s easy run (which is always 4.8km in the base plan) consistently became cross-training on the bike (indoor trainer until early April, outdoor rides thereafter), both to limit injury risk and also allow me to pile on more aerobic work. At the peak of my cycling block in spring 2023, I was averaging 350km/week, so I knew from experience that I could ramp up bike volume and intensity considerably faster than running. For easy aerobic work, I also just vastly prefer riding to running. The order of the T/R workouts in the plan was also flexible depending on my schedule and Ottawa\u2019s incredibly fickle March/April weather.\n* To gain back some of the lost running mileage from the switch, every long run was 1km longer than the plan called for.\n* Monday\u2019s cross-training sometimes became a second rest day, depending on how my legs were feeling.\n* Instead of a week 6 10k and week 9 15k, I ran the St. Lawrence 10k as a tuneup race on April 26 (Week 8). I juggled the schedule to accommodate the switch, and added a long, hilly ride in Week 9 to have something of a de-loading week afterwards.\n\nThe training block generally went really well. I ran a 21:11 PB in the 5k TT in horrible conditions (flurries and crosswinds), then ran a 44:25 in the St. Lawrence 10k (good for Top 20 and 21s off my PB). The training block also benefitted from good sleep habits (averaging almost 8.5hrs/night since February), no major travel, and drastically cutting down on weekday alcohol consumption. That allowed for the most consistent block I've ever managed: I missed one run the entire block, putting down 390km of running and 640km of biking between March 1 and May 24, peaking at 47.5km of running in Week 10. Began tapering 10-11 days out from the race, and was feeling relatively good throughout (usual Taper Scaries notwithstanding).\n\nI live near the route, and my office is \\~100 meters from the startline. This also meant I was able to recon every part of the course multiple times, including a 20.5km LR in week 10 that was essentially a dress rehearsal of the race. Between past Ottawa Race Weekends and runs on in-office days, I\u2019ve run the finishing 2-3km north of thirty times.\n\nThe Higdon Intermediate 2 plan was fine, though with some things I liked and some things I didn\u2019t like:\n\n* The plan was simple, which made planning individual weeks and runs very easy (and also lent itself to plug-and-play with cross-training on the bike and to needed schedule adjustments to reflect when my tuneup races were) BUT not particularly periodized or as distance-focused as a Pfitzinger or Hanson plan.\n* The back-to-back pace and long runs on weekends were a great confidence builder for race day, BUT meant that weekly mileage was incredibly back-loaded. I consistently had plans to add cross-training on Mondays and my legs frequently went \u201cnah\u201d the morning of due to accumulated fatigue from the Sat/Sun runs.\n* The plan started gently compared to my weekly mileage during base-building, BUT I also feel like there wouldn\u2019t be a ton of time gains to be had from prepping another Half with this training plan.\n\nIn sum, I generally agree with the sub\u2019s consistent feedback on Higdon plans: it was a great plan for my first crack at the distance, and particularly as someone who has struggled with ramping up running mileage too quickly in the past, but it's not a plan I'll be using again.\n\n# The Race\n\nCarb-loaded Saturday night at my wife and mine\u2019s favourite Italian restaurant, strolled three blocks to watch some of the 10k \u2013 including both ME and WE elite \u2013 then got as much sleep as adrenaline would allow. Woke up at 6am Sunday, showered, ate my ritual pre-race breakfast (a breakfast sandwich from Kettleman\u2019s Bagels \u2013 an Ottawa institution) then took the LRT downtown. Used my office\u2019s locker room to change and for bag storage, did an easy 2k to warm up with a few race pace pickups, and then wolfed down an energy bar about 25min prior to the start.. I raced this Half in Nike Vaporfly 3s, which I'd also used for my 10k tuneup in April.\n\nCompared to past Ottawa race weekends, conditions were fantastic Sunday morning: partly cloudly, lightly breezy, and 11C when the Half started. I slotted into the first time corral (1:45 or faster), found the 1:40 pacers, and waited for the gun to go. The plan was to stick with the pacers until 15-16kms, then make a judgment call about whether I enough left in the legs to push the pace once the course was through the final hill on Sussex Dr.\n\n**Part 1: Vibing (Start - 12km)**\n\nThe Half started at 9am on the dot. In previous Race Weekends running the 5k or 10k, it's been a knife fight to escape crowding in the opening km of people who've insisted on being at the front despite not running \"at the front\" times, but this was not the case this year. Our group was up to speed by the time the race turned onto Wellington St. in front of Parliament Hill. Settled into a rhythm very quickly and began knocking out kms at race pace (or close to it) as the race wound into Gatineau. Sticking with the pace group made the first half incredibly straightforward from a mental standpoint - didn't really have to think about pace, just stuck with the group and knocked out steady kms. My wife and two friends of ours were in the cheer zones at the 2km mark (just before crossing the Booth St. bridge into Gatineau) and then again at around 10kms in when the race crossed back into Ottawa near the National Gallery. The crowds were *electric* \\- this is the best weather that Ottawa Race Weekend has had since probably 2019, and the city showed up accordingly.\n\nThe back half of the course was rolly, so we pushed the pace in the opening half. My watch had me running a little ahead of the splits I was targetting - 18:41 through 4km, 37:48 through 8km, 56:36 through 12kms. I also stuck to my fueling plan, taking in gels at 25min and 50min and using my disposable bottle of electrolyte mix until I discarded it at the 9km aid station.\n\n**Part 2: Hurting (12km - 16.5km)**\n\nWith hindsight, the blisters on the arches of both feet probably developed in the 9-10km stretch, but they became impossible to ignore at around 12kms as the Half course headed along Sussex into the Rockliffe Park area. Almost immediately, it became clear that the one on my right foot was both larger and worse than the one on the left foot.\n\nStill, pushing through discomfort is part of the gig - both my tuneup races were run in bad weather, in 2023 I rode [the first day of Rideau Lakes](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/49335537) through a biblical rainstorm (and then rode [the second day](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/49444378) with all of the accompanying chafing and contact point pain). So for the next 4-4.5kms, I just dialed in and kept at goal pace through the rollers on the GEC Parkway. This year's course ran through the grounds of Rideau Hall (for non-Canadians, the residence of the Governor General, our stand-in Head of State on the 363-5 days of the year when the King isn't in town), which was an unbelievably cool moment. I struggled with the overpass on Sussex drive, but was somehow still hustling despite the steadily-worsening pain in my right foot. I split 1:15:39 through 16kms - almost exactly on sub-1:40 pace.\n\n**Part 3: Surviving (16.5km - Finish)**\n\nDespite holding onto goal pace through the first ten miles, by this point I knew I was running on borrowed time: the temperature was rising, and my fuel gauge was steadily falling as the pain gauge steadily increased. At around 16.5kms, the lines crossed one another and the wheels began to come off. The pain from the blister was excruciating - basically every step felt like jabbing a knife into the underside of my right foot. The left foot was in better shape, but not by much. From then onwards, my pace slowed considerably, and I was promptly dropped by the 1:40 pace group (which by this point had maybe 10-12 people left in it).\n\nHad this been another race, I'd have likely stepped off the course at this point and DNF'd to avoid inflicting even more damage on my foot. But this was both my goal race for the spring calendar and my first time racing a Half, so there was no way that was happening. Faced with coming back with my shield or on it, I opted for both.\n\nThe last 4.6kms of the race were mostly a fight for survival. I'd run as close to goal pace as I could for as long as the pain would allow, then walk for 10-15s, then repeat. By this point, my racing shirt was also soaked from both sweat and water I'd poured over myself when going through aid stations, and I was chafing to the point of drawing blood. Those final few kms along the Rideau Canal felt eternal - no matter how many times I've run them in training (and I've run them a lot) they're always a miserable slog come race day. However, they were buoyed by the crowds, which by this point in the race were absolute pandemonium. My ears were ringing the entire finishing stretch.\n\nI bled time through the final 5kms, but generally kept on running as fast as I was able for as long as I was able, before emptying the tank in the final 100m. I ultimately crossed the line in 1:43:2x.\n\n# Post-Race Thoughts\n\nI was *shattered* at the finish line, and slowly made my way through the finishing chute and back into the mingling area at Confederation Park. My wife was waiting for me, and after the embrace she took one look at me - limping, covered in sweat, bleeding from both nips - and simply said \"you look...unwell.\" I briefly chatted with a couple friends who were running either the Half or the Full on similar schedules, picked up my bag from my office (a hack that I will be repeating as long as I work in that building - saved me probably 20-30min in a bag line), then headed home and did after-care on the blisters. Somehow, the right arch blister didn't pop on the course, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose two toenails (one on each foot) from the race as well. Woke up Monday morning feeling (physically) like I'd been hit by a bus, but also still riding the emotional high of having finished my first Half-Marathon.\n\nI ended up short of my goal, but I can't be too disappointed with my time given what transpired on the course. I have a session with my physio (who's enough of a running geek that it's like having a coach that my insurance pays for) later this week to chat through what happened, but I strongly suspect the fault lies with the narrowness of the Vaporflys' midfoot/arch area combined with my own very flat arches. It was also a good reminder that **nothing** is guaranteed on race day: you can put in a great training block, taper well, have a good racing and fueling plan, and sometimes things go wrong anyways because racing, if done well, involves putting your body right up against the limit of what it can do (and sometimes pushing a little beyond it).\n\nI also know what I'll be looking for in a future training block: now that I know my body can handle higher mileage without breaking down, I'll be looking to add volume next time I prep for a Half - either Pfitz 12/55 or one of the Hanson plans (probably the former, as I quite liked the 4 days running, 1-2 days biking schedule of this past spring) - and a plan that adds race pace to the end of long runs. Without the blister, I think I could've plausibly finished in the high-1:41/low-1:42 range, but I will need to add more miles at race pace on already-fatigued legs to get through those brutally hard final 5km and under 1:40.\n\nAs for the near future, this marks the end of my spring running season. After recovering for the next couple weeks - including vacation in Spain - I'll be pivoting to road cycling for the summer, with running primarily serving a recovery and cross-training role. Physically and mentally, I need a break from high running volume and race prep. The current plan is to run a 10k or two in the Fall, and then prep to take another swing at a sub-1:40 Half in 2026 (current thinking is Ottawa or/and Toronto Waterfront, but I'm still in the very early stages of planning this). This was my first half-marathon, but it absolutely won't be my last.\n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by u/herumph.",

Without getting too deep I am just trying to have some honest thoughts about why I ran and what kept me from doing it in the past.\n\nI started running about 5 years ago a bit before turning 30 as a \u201cpretty big guy\u201d I was 5ft10 305-310lbs. I\u2019m now down to 220, but to put it bluntly, still a \u201cpretty big guy\u201d big gut, moobs, and unflattering jiggles in race day photos galore. While I see myself as a runner, I get lots of comments about how I don\u2019t look like a runner, how people are surprised I could finish a run, or I don\u2019t want to finish behind you. It\u2019s always weird to me, and people usually try to pass it off as some sort of compliment (maybe it is and I am still a bit insecure), but it\u2019s the reality and I hear the comments a lot.\n\nI had always wanted to be a runner. Why? I don\u2019t really know. It just appealed to me is all I can say. A combination of shame, lack of confidence, and lack of ability had always stopped me from even starting, but this time it stuck. I started off trying to run a mile in under 10 minutes, a 5k under 30 minutes, a 10k under an hour, a half under 2 hours, and finally just run a marathon. Each time I hit a goal I moved on to the next step. New starting line new distance. I never wanted to linger at the current distance or try to improve it past those times. I just had eyes for the marathon. I told everyone I\u2019d never do it, but when I\u2019d reflect I knew I just said that because if I failed I\u2019d just be too ashamed to admit I couldn\u2019t do it, and with the weight that seemed like an even more shameful failure. The first 3 years I ran anywhere from 200-600 miles a year, the 4th year I ran a bit over 1300, and now I\u2019m currently at 850\n\n|Mile|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n|1|9:13|\n|2|8:46|\n|3|8:39|\n|4|8:33|\n|5|8:48|\n|6|8:31|\n|7|8:48|\n|8|8:46|\n|9|8:33|\n|10|8:36|\n|11|8:44|\n|12|8:39|\n|13|9:13|\n|14|9:00|\n|15|8:49|\n|16|8:43|\n|17|9:00|\n|18|8:55|\n|19|8:53|\n|20|9:15|\n|21|8:56|\n|22|8:58|\n|23|9:37|\n|24|9:31|\n|25|10:24|\n|26|8:41|\n|27|8:18|\n\n**Training**\n\nThe year I ran my first Marathon a year ago and I did an NRC training. Just with the goal to finish. I had never done anything over 13 miles and knew I just needed to be able to run the distance. I finished at 4:58, falling apart quite badly at mile 21. After that I started training using Hal Higdon\u2019s app, but never did a marathon after that training block. For 2025 I decided I would run Chicago, and I wanted to give it an honest effort. I decided I would do the pfitz 18/55 plan, and that I\u2019d do a practice marathon with that same training block. The goal was to finish the plan, see if I can handle the volume, and run under 4 hours at a relatively easy pace to start the next 18/55 feeling fresh. I bought the book and set up the google sheet I found on Reddit to track my runs and get my paces with a 4 hour goal. I managed to finish every run but one. A 12-mile run, I wasn\u2019t feeling after a crummy week, I decided to be done with at mile 6. I just didn\u2019t want to be in my head anymore that day. I hit all the goal paces, and I remember being ecstatic at completing the 18 mile with 14 miles MP exactly at 9 minutes. I negative split 2/3 of my 20-mile runs. Since I never go back to a race I PR\u2019d all the other distances during my training runs. Nothing crazy as it was in the middle of a lot of running, but still nice to see (Mile 7:11, 5k 23:11, 10k 48:05, HM 1:54). I lost about 20 pounds over the course of those 18 weeks. I made sure to eat right and drink enough water. I maintained an emphasis on having quality runs. So I went to bed early, made sure I was hydrated, and ate right before hard sessions (I tried to do this for every run, but more focused on the hard ones). I also lifted 5 days a week with a PPL plan where I did legs only once a week. Honestly, I just followed the most repeated advice here. Did my easy runs easy, got miles on my feet, put in hard effort for hard runs, and I trusted the process.\n\n**Pre-Race/Race**\n\nI decided early on that this would not be an all out effort. I wanted it to feel easy and controlled and to get to the end in under 4 hours. I decided I\u2019d walk through all the aid stations to grab water, I would high five anyone waiting for one, tap any signs that offered a boost, and to track down my girlfriend for a kiss at any of the points she was meeting me. There is also one big hill towards the end, I decided early on I was just walking. I told myself I\u2019d follow the 10/10/10 rule and to also tell myself that all my training was for that last 10k. I wish I could break it down mile by mile but honestly it felt like I looked down at my watch and I was at mile 13. Made it through a little bit of a climb and a bathroom stop and all of a sudden I was at mile 19. I ran strong from there since my girlfriend called me to tell me she was adding a stop at mile 22 and I wanted to see her. After that I felt like I had it. I enjoyed the next two miles at a pretty easy pace since it was uphill and I wanted to finish strong later, I walked up that hill, and spent a few minutes fixing my bib (to be honest my nipples were bleeding pretty bad and I didn\u2019t want it to ruin the photos). I got to mile 25 and went to cruise control from there.\n\n**Post-Race**\n\nA week has passed, and I\u2019m proud of that run but more proud of the entire 4 month block. I took a week off, and my legs feel great. I\u2019ll be starting the same 18/55 training block in a bit for Chicago with a goal of 3:30. Maybe a stretch, but failing is fine.",

    "title": "William Goodge and the HR Controversy",
    "selftext": "I'm a bit late to the party here, but having just read [this article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-21/why-has-william-goodge-s-trans-australia-run-turned-toxic/105313388) setting out the controversy around HR - **I am not at all convinced that there is compelling evidence of fraud.**\n\n**Allegation:** Goodge's low HR readings indicate he didn't actually run over some of the distances he covered during his record breaking Trans-Australia crossing (3,800km in 35 days averaging 110km/day). \n\n**Qualification(?):** I am a former semi-pro (semi-amateur?) cyclist, later cycling coach with riders anywhere from novices to national representation at world championship events, so I've spent a lot of time looking at my own and others' HR data. I've switched to running in the last 3 years, 3:02 Marathon, 1:26 1/2M, 35:58 10km.\n\n**Firstly:** He doesn\u2019t use a chest strap for HR so I don\u2019t think his HR readings are at all accurate in the first place. I know my wrist sensor is unreliable which is why I generally use a chest strap instead. My wrist sensor often continues to show an HR reading for a short while after I\u2019ve taken it off, doesn\u2019t keep up when there are sudden spikes (ie if I\u2019m doing intervals it often lags at a lower HR), and seems to get \u2018stuck\u2019 at either very high or very low HRs for periods of time. Why exactly he wouldn\u2019t just use a strap to put this to bed is curious, although: a) it\u2019s personal preference in that a lot of people feel chest straps are uncomfortable; and b) I\u2019m not sure it would change much (see below).\n\n**Secondly,** HR is highly variable person to person. When I\u2019m fatigued my HR gets seriously depressed, often unable to get far over 150bpm even in extreme effort. When I was racing full time, doing 4 x 110+km events per week in the Belgian/Dutch racing season i'd be sprinting all out and look down to see \\~145bpm. That\u2019s a fraction of the kind of fatigue he\u2019d be dealing with and he\u2019s doing an endurance event with no need for spikes in effort. I've also had coaching clients who'd ride Z2/Z3 (based on power meters, not HR zones) at 170-180bpm, and some who did the same in 135-150bpm. As regards these depressions in HR tending to occur later in the day, it's very possible the is the result of culmination of fatigue on the heart, which is a muscle and subject to the same stresses you might feel in your calves or quads towards the end of a half marathon.\n\n**Thirdly,** he\u2019s running really *really* slow. Go out and TRY to run in the high 7min/km range and you\u2019ll find you are basically doing a jaunty walk. Making comparisons to Brockman's HR values in this regard is to present red herrings - **Brockmann** 5:42/km (102km) v **Goodge** 7:55/km (110km), **Brockman** 6:28/km (106km) v **Goodge** 7:47/km (113km). Those speeds are WORLDS apart, especially the first example where he\u2019s running 39% slower than Nedd. Consider that iff they had both set out to run 110km that day, Brockman would have been home and hosed almost 4 hours before Goodge. In the world of HR variability with the added aspect of fatigue, it\u2019s not at all linear. 39% slower at a Z1/Z2 pace could be the difference of 60bpm, depending on the person.\n\n**Fianlly,** as for the GPS blips where he appears to be going 60-80kph or doing 3:30/km at times, I am sure we have all experienced this - it's extremely common for tiny GPS watch devices.\n\nNo smoke without fire and all that, but from what I've seen put forward to substantiate the claims of fraud, I'm not convinced.",

The updates rolling out over the coming weeks focus on helping users optimize their workout routes to compete against other users and their own personal bests, building on some of the\u00a0[existing AI features that Strava announced last year](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158290/strava-ai-dark-mode-night-heat-maps-family-subscription).\n\n>Anyone paying for a Strava subscription (starting at $11.99 monthly) can now access a new AI-powered routes experience under the Maps tab that should provide more intuitive suggestions based on popular routes enjoyed by other Strava users. Users can generate community-backed routes from custom starting points or their current location, pulling data from Strava\u2019s heatmaps feature.\n\n>Other route-related updates will be rolled out to the Strava mobile app in the coming months, including changes to the tappable points of interest (POI) feature that currently enables subscribers to instantly generate routes to caf\u00e9s, restrooms, viewpoints, and other locations. Starting in June, POI\u2019s will also display elevation, distance, and estimated arrival time information, and allow users to upload photos of the location. Point-to-point routing will also launch in July, which uses heatmaps and machine learning to deliver \u201cthe most efficient, activity-specific route from A to B,\u201d according to Strava.\n\n>Strava is also doubling the number of live segments, which allow users to view real-time performance data and achievements in sections of their route, and introducing additional data screens for subscribers.\n\n>Finally, Strava says it\u2019s \u201ccontinuing to advance\u201d the AI-powered Leaderboard Integrity feature it launched to weed out cheaters on cycling and running paths. The company says that 4.45 million activity logs have been removed so far that carried the wrong sport type, or were recorded in vehicles \u2014 which is an easy way to fabricate scores now that e-bikes can make anyone the king of a mountain.\n\n\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/news/671452/strava-ai-routes-leaderboard-update](https://www.theverge.com/news/671452/strava-ai-routes-leaderboard-update)",

I have played soccer all my life, but never considered myself a good \"runner.\" Do you remember those president fitness awards they would hand out in elementary school? I would always pass all the challenges except running a mile under 10 minutes. This translated in me thinking I could never be a good runner. However, 6 years ago, I signed up for my first 5k. Since then, I have done another 5k and an olympic distance triathlon. This year I finally signed up for a half marathon after wanting to do one since last year.\n\n\\### Training\n\nI followed the 80/20 Running 15 week plan. I really liked the structure of the plan and the different runs. It does however require a lot of patience. I noticed improvement in my heart rate zone trainings, but it can be incredibly annoying at times when my heart rate spikes, and I have to run/walk extra slow to bring it down to zone 2 or zone 1. I tried to follow the plan as much as possible although the first several weeks I ended up missing long runs due to travel and calf aches. For some reason, I didn't start stretching after my long runs which contributed to aches. In addition, I ran 7 days a week (I know major no no. Idk what I was thinking). However mid-way through my training, I buckled down and got back on plan with my long runs. I also made sure to run no more than 4x a week.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nThe day before, I had a double serving of pasta and meat sauce. I felt a little bad given how much I ate including when I did a 20 min zone 1 run. However, this paid off the next day (race day). I ate waffles with water and a gu. I also made sure to do my favorite runners stretch. Once I got to the venue, I waited with my corral group for the start. Thankfully it was an overcast day in the 50s, perfect weather for a run. I was not as nervous as I thought I would be. I luckily got good sleep. I was a lot more nervous for my triathlon.\n\n\\### Race\n\nI had nothing on me except 4 gus and my phone. I read up on a lot of tips from previous half marathon/marathon runners. The main thing I did at the start was run slower than my goal pace. During my training, I was able to run a pace of 12:37 min. I knew I wanted to aim for sub 2.5 hours. I conspired a plan of running a 13 min first mile, 12 min miles 2-6, and 11 min miles 7-13.1. I was able to aim for a pace around 13 min for my first mile, but it was so easy to run faster. With people passing me and the thrill of my first race, I actively had to slow down when I started going faster. By mile 2, I kicked it up to a 12 minute pace, but I still had to hold myself back from going faster. Mile 4 was through the zoo which was nice although there weren't too many animals out. The highlight was seeing an elephant, but I didn't stop at all. The race narrowed a bit here so it was a little cumbersome going around people. An hour in, I took a gu. By mile 6, I started going 11 min, and that still felt pretty good and easy to maintain as the sun was coming out. The course was overall flat with a few hills. Up the hills, I naturally slowed down but allowed myself to go faster downhill while keeping my pace during the flat parts. I took another gu after 1.5 hours in. My left knee started hurting a bit around mile 8. Luckily, I still kept my pace. The pain went away a couple of miles later. I felt a couple of aches in my calf or feet but they lasted a short time and went away. By mile 10, I had about 32 minutes left. I knew I was very close to meeting my sub 2.5 hour goal, but I would need to run 10 minute miles. I took another gu. This was when I pushed myself more. It was during this part that the race narrowed a bit due to sharing the road with the marathon/urban 10 runners. I had to maneuver around people. This was when I consistently passed people. It felt great, I knew I had paced myself well. In the last mile, I tried to hit a sub 9 min / mile, but I was hitting my limit as I naturally kept slowing down. However, I kept powering and telling myself that I still had fuel left in the tank. I was sprinting at this point and finished strong.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nWhat an amazing feeling to finish the race and finish so powerfully. Obviously my first thought was how close I was to meeting my time goal, but I tried to focus on the other awesome parts of the race. I was so proud of myself for my pacing. I had never run such fast miles and to do it for the first time in a race felt astonishing. The fact that I was able to continue to speed up and feel good about it was a great feeling. This probably means I could have stuck with an 11:27 mi pace in order to meet my 2.5 hour goal since I probably had a little more left in the tank, but I have no regrets. On to the next race!\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by\u00a0[u/herumph](/user/herumph/).",

    "selftext": "*(First time post - apologies if this should be on the achievements thread, but it's a wider question rather than my particularly wanting to mark what might be a fake achievement.)*\n\nI started running only in my late 40s, and initially I struggled to hit a 30 minute 5k. Once I could, trying to work towards a 25 minute 5k seemed like a realistic goal. It's taken me 3 years but, today (I'm just coming up to 51 now) I finally managed the distance in 24:57, which is \\~40 seconds off my previous PB.\n\nIt wasn't fun: really felt like I'd squeezed out the last of my energy and left me briefly nauseous. But I'm slightly bugged out by the fact I'm managed this while I'm on medication for rhinitis, a 10-day, 40mg/day course of Prednisone which I believe is a banned substance, known to improve performance.\n\nThat's not anything to worry about of course but knowing it did diminish my sense of achievement in having made the barrier. I don't know how much difference it might make, and I keep telling myself that it's no different to my going out and buying a pair of supershoes (I run in cheapy Floatride 4s) but a bit of me kind of feels a little sour about it.\n\nNot really sure where I go from here? Can I legitimately claim I ran a 25 minute 5k without riders? Is it something I should chalk up do the drugs and maybe build on, keep trying to beat, or even better once the medication is done - in honestly it felt like a lot of effort and I'm not getting any younger?  Or do I just say I'm happy having done it at all, ever, and go back to slightly less frantic runs?",

    "selftext": "# Race Information\n\n* **Name:**\u00a0HiPRO Utrecht Half Marathon\n* **Date:**\u00a0May 18th, 2025\n* **Distance:**\u00a0Half Marathon\n* **Location:**\u00a0Utrecht, The Netherlands\n* **Website:**\u00a0[https://utrechtmarathon.com/en/](https://utrechtmarathon.com/en/)\n* **Time:**\u00a01:53:23\n\n# Goals\n\n* Primary goal: Sub 2 (Achieved)\n* Stretch goal: ~~1:50:00~~  1:55:00 (Adjusted due to injuries \u2013 Achieved)\n* Real goal: Beat my colleague and earn bragging rights (Nailed it.)\n\n# Background\n\nThis was my second half marathon. I signed up for it at the end of 2024, after some friends from college (who live in Utrecht) proposed we all run it together. I\u2019d just started getting into longer runs and thought, why not. Then I saw it would have around 15,000 participants \u2014 and since I get a bit stressed with big crowds, I figured it was a good idea to first test myself in a smaller local HM (\\~800 participants) to get used to the whole race-day thing. That was back in April, and I was in very good shape. PB\u2019d at 1:50:13.\n\n# Training\n\nThis didn\u2019t go as planned.\n\nFor my first HM in April I followed the \"Amy Garmin Coach HM plan\" with 4 days of trainning per week, though I started with higher milleage than the coach reccomended. In practice this consisted in a two slow runs, 1 day of series, 1 long run per week.\n\nI expected a quick recovery from the April race and a smooth transition into Utrecht\u2026 but no. I struggled more than I thought to bounce back, and then I had a fall that led to a sort of tendinitis in my hip. That kept me quiet for a few weeks, and after that, I reduced both the frequency and length of my runs to avoid a reinjury. The original plan was to keep with a \"Coach Amy\" style training, but with the injury weekly mileage dropped from \\~45 km to \\~20 km, and I only managed two long-ish runs of 17 km in the month and a half before the race. I initially aimed for a 1:50 finish, but I adjusted that to 1:55 once it was clear my legs weren\u2019t in full form.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe start & finish lines are in the Utrech Science park, outside of the main city. The area is good for logistics as it has a lot of space, though it may be a bit hard to reach if you don't bike.\n\nBiked \\~8 km from where we were staying to the starting area \u2014 pretty solid warm-up, actually. But yeah, the crowd was a bit much. I\u2019m used to running alone in the forest, with the occasional bird or roe deer as the only spectators. Here, there were thousands of people cheering, music blasting, and runners everywhere. I was in Wave 3, got into the starting box at my assigned time, but somehow ended up surrounded by Wave 4 bibs. Not sure what I messed up, but when the race started, I had to weave through a big chunk of the pack in some pretty narrow streets.\n\n# Race\n\nMy legs felt heavy at the start \u2014 not terrible, just not fresh. But after a couple of km I got into a solid rhythm, pacing right at 5:18/km like a metronome. I guess that's the nice thing of a flat race.\n\nThe initial kms were a bit stressing, too much dodging having to overtake the Wave 4 crowd. Things got a lot better after KM 5, once I managed to overtake the 2:00:00 pacers and the field opened up a bit. The crowd support was great \u2014 but at times, it was overstimulating. I honestly enjoyed most the \\~7 km in the middle of the race where we left the city, passed through nature and smaller villages, and the crowd got more sparse. That stretch felt a lot closer to my usual training runs \u2014 more peaceful, and easier to focus.\n\nThat held until about KM 17, when my dip in training started to show. So I slowed to around 5:25\u20135:30/km for the last few kilometers.\n\nCouple of annoyances:\n\n* At water stations, why does everyone throw their cups on the floor when there were more than enough huge trash cans *right there*? I get it if you miss, but this was just chaos.\n* \u201cSocial running groups\u201d: I ran into several clusters of 4\u20135 people chatting and jogging side by side in narrow paths, going slower than the pace around them. Totally fine to run together, but when you block the whole road, there's plenty of room in front of you, and create a bottleneck, it\u2019s a bit annoying \u2014 especially when you're starting to feel tired and just want to keep your rhythm.\n\n# Post-race\n\nFinished in 1:53:23 \u2014 3 minutes slower than my PB, but I\u2019ll take it. Most importantly, I beat the two colleagues I had to beat. That buys me bragging rights until the next one, which is what truly matters.\n\nThe race goodies felt a bit short for the price, compared to other races I've participated (60ish euros for the medal, a chocolate bar and the tshirt).\n\nBut seriously, the weekend with my friends was great. The race was just an excuse, and in the end, that\u2019s the part that sticks.\n\n# Splits\n\n|Split|Pace|\n|:-|:-|\n|1|5:19\u00a0/km|\n|2|5:17\u00a0/km|\n|3|5:16\u00a0/km|\n|4|5:17\u00a0/km|\n|5|5:19\u00a0/km|\n|6|5:19\u00a0/km|\n|7|5:20\u00a0/km|\n|8|5:17\u00a0/km|\n|9|5:20\u00a0/km|\n|10|5:19\u00a0/km|\n|11|5:19\u00a0/km|\n|12|5:16\u00a0/km|\n|13|5:17\u00a0/km|\n|14|5:16\u00a0/km|\n|15|5:18\u00a0/km|\n|16|5:18\u00a0/km|\n|17|5:26\u00a0/km|\n|18|5:25\u00a0/km|\n|19|5:26\u00a0/km|\n|20|5:29\u00a0/km|\n|21|5:34\u00a0/km|\n|22|5:23\u00a0/km|",

My first was Mount Desert Island in Maine in 2022, which I ran in 4:55:05. I did that without a time goal, just wanted to finish without walking except at aid stations. I was hesitant to say out loud I wanted to beat that time at Big Sur (even though I sorta did) because I knew it was a harder course, and before I started training again, my running habit was sporadic at best, so I was still functionally a beginner.\n\n### Training\nThe first time I ran I used the program in the book by the Iowa professors who taught the marathon class, The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer. Highly recommend for the combination of physical and mental prep! Very, very good training program for new runners who just want to finish.\n\nThis time I used the \"To Finish\" program in the Galloway book MARATHON: YOU CAN DO IT. The Galloway plan was different in several key ways: It was longer, 26 weeks instead of 16; it called for just three runs a week instead of four; it ramped up to higher mileage (the longest run was 26 miles, instead of 18); and it required slowing down and taking regular walk breaks on long runs.\n\nI thought about following the time-goal plan for 4:40 but honestly it was too intimidating in terms of time commitment (4 runs/week + cross training) and running experience in general (I have never done mile repeats before). The \"To Finish\" program was ideal for me in terms of commitment level, and also it was nice to only have to run outside 3x a week while training through the winter. The \"To Finish\" ALSO called for cross training 3x a week but I really struggled to get that done and skipped most of them.\n\nIt is what it is, I did the most important part of the training, but I might have seen more improvement from my first marathon if I had done more XT, whether walking/cycling for cardiovascular health or more yoga to work on overall strength. (I did do a few yoga classes after some weekend long runs gave me knee pain, but couldn't keep up the habit and when the knee pain went away, I stopped going.)\n\nLongest training run was 26+ miles, which I finished in just under six hours even running slow/easy with very frequent walk breaks. Made me confident I could *most likely* finish Big Sur in the time limit.\n\n### Pre-race\nFlew into SFO from NYC on Thursday, spend night in Watsonville near family. Checked into hotel on Friday, easy 30 minute jog/walk on pedestrian/bike path in Monterey, Chinese take-out for dinner. Day of the race went to expo, went to beach, soaked in the hot tub (Is pre-race hot tubbing recommended or not? My boyfriend kept warning me to not get dehydrated but I thought relaxation would do me some good, keep me calm.) Pizza for dinner (restaurant was packed with other runners in the race shirt and I was sad to not be wearing mine). In bed relaxing by ~8 but realistically didn't fall asleep until 10 or 11. Had coffee on the bus, and a bar, and a banana someone left at the start line, and a stroopwafel right before race time.\n\n### Race\nIt was misty/rainy/chilly at the start line and I agonized over whether to wear a short or long sleeve t-shirt. I dreaded getting too hot if the rain let up later, so went with the short sleeves and I was cold for a good part of the early race, especially on walk breaks. Still, better too cold than too hot.\n\nMy strategy was to run for 4 minutes and walk for one, taking shorter walk breaks and running faster on downhills and longer walk breaks, if necessary, on uphills. It was really hard to stop and walk so early into the race, but I forced myself to stick with the plan, and honestly it worked out so well. I think I was able to conserve energy overall and sped up some at the end, relative to the middle of the race (first five miles were still the fastest but they're net downhill I think and I didn't run them significantly faster than the rest of the race). Also the mile downhill after Hurricane Point was the fastest ever recorded on my watch so that was fun!\n\nEverything went really well, even considering the rain. I did wish I ate more in advance, because even taking gels ~45 minutes or so my stomach started growling. My legs were twinge-y from the start but it never escalated to full blown pain.\n\nI was trading places with the Corral C 5:00 pacer for a while but eventually caught up to the Corral B 5:00 pacer and started to wonder if I should have been my ambitious when I gave my expected finish time so I was in Corral B. I wondered if I could have run a 4:50 if I had had a faster pacer to chase? Fastest in Corral C was 5:00... I had been afraid to set a specific time goal for myself because I didn't want to miss it but maybe I played it too safe?\n\n### Post-race\nOne thing that Galloway's method promises is that the walk breaks help you feel better after the race and I largely found that to be true. Vacationed in Big Sur and Yosemite the week after and went on lots of hikes, so leaned into active recovery. Biggest injury was a giant blister under one of my toenails, I think because of wet shoes/steep downhills.\n\nWas in general just so very pleased and proud with how this race went. I've run two marathons so far and both I chose because of the natural beauty of the setting more than anything else, so speed isn't my number one priority; feeling strong and enjoying myself is. But still, felt nice to knock ~3:30 off my previous time! It's not a dramatic improvement but still felt so good.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

Following running 3:04 at the Amsterdam Marathon 2024 I wanted to target going sub-3 in 2025. I'm also doing Valencia in December, and while I felt that was more a realistic target to crack the sub-3 my aim was to see how the training went and maybe give it a shot at the Leeds marathon.\n\nThis would a challenge of not only taking over four minutes off my PB in 6 months, but also difficult considering the Leeds marathon is much hillier that the famously flat Amsterdam race - (I've listed the grade-adjusted-miles in brackets on my splits)\n\n# Training\n\nFor Amsterdam I had followed Pfitz's 18/55 plan, and really enjoyed it, this time I felt I was capable of running a higher mileage for this block, and more than 5 times a week. I thought I would give 18/70 a shot, with the plan of knocking a few miles off a week and listening to my body when it was proving too much.\n\nBecause I'm a data nerd I wrote the sessions out on excel and graded how I did in each session. This wasn't by no means completely scientific (I know missing a 4M recovery run isn't as bad as missing a 18M long run) however it was more for me just to get an idea of how many of the sessions I was nailing. My final score was 76% which although far from perfect I felt very happy with considering how heavy work had been, and I also that I'd moved house at the most critical point of the training.\n\nUnlike Amsterdam and London, I also hadn't been ill during the block. On both those occasions I lost nearly 2 weeks of training so that was a massive boost.  However I was weary of the hills that Yorkshire had in store for me, coming from London this was not something I was used to and it wasn't until the final few weeks when I moved that I tried to add some hill miles to my training, how much I struggled on these knocked my confidence quite a bit.\n\nHowever, come the end of training the more important stats for me were that in the 16 weeks before tapering I average 41.6 miles (up from 27.7 miles prior to Amsterdam), had peak week mileage of 62 (up from 56), and achieved 50M+ weeks nine times, compared to four prior to Amsterdam.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe week before the race I made the decision, considering the gains I'd made in training, I was going to take a big swing and go for the Sub-3. I was confident I could do it on a flat course, but on this course, much less sure. However, having worked so hard for 18 weeks I was just of the mindset of what have I got to lose.\n\nI always write the splits and accumulative-split-time on physio tape and attach this to my arms when I do big races. If I was to crack the sub-3 I'd need to run 6:50 min miles on the flats (taking into account the extra .3/4 you run in a marathon).\n\nMy strategy would be to concede time on the uphills and then make it back on the downhills. I didn't want a situation where I was losing a minute on the uphill and began to panic, and think I was more tired than actually was, or cruise on the downhills and not maximise the help that the decline could give.\n\nThe course essentially consists of two massive hills, one at 6miles and another around 18miles, there are very few flat sections. I wanted to know exactly what each split needed to be, and where the hills were, so to do this I looked at the 2024 years results, found someone with a unique name and then searched them on Strava. I found someone with the Leeds Marathon race their profile which included all the mile gradients. I then used this site (https://apps.runningwritings.com/gap-calculator/) to work out what the pace I needed to hit to be on for 6:50 per mile. Interestingly this site was much more generous than Strava's GAP.\n\nI was actually quite calm about running the uphills, they were nearly a minute slower. What scared me more was a massive downhill of -240 feet which meant I had to run a 5:35 split. I don't think I've ever ran a 5:35 minute mile in my life! But this was my strategy and I was going to try and stick to it best I could\n\nI arrived an hour before the race at Headingley stadium where the start would be in honour of the late great Rob Burrow. I'm glad I got there early as there was a big queue down this narrow alleyway to enter the stadium complex where bag-drop/toilets were and entry to the start line.\n\nThe queues for the toilets were very long, not a surprise for these big races, but I do feel 30 minutes seems excessive but maybe I've been lucky previously? Another issue I had was that once inside the stadium area there didn't seem to be anywhere really to warm up. I managed to jog a KM while trying to work out which toilets were the least queued despite the packed setting.\n\nI also don't think the start area was marked up very well. There also seemed a bit of confusion over if the marathon and the half-marathon, which was happening simultaneously was commencing at the same place. As 7000 of the runners were doing the half marathon which started at 10am, and 3000 were starting the marathon at 9am, everyone was walking in different directions meaning it wasn't at obvious as normal. I'd be interested to know if others felt the same way, or if I was just being a dunce and panicked in the situation.\n\nAnyway, a very helpful marshal pointed me in the direction of the start line and I got to the right place with around 5 minutes to spare to do some dynamic stretching with all my pre-race needs met so no harm done.\n\n# Race\n\nAnd like that, it began. As always, despite going to the toilet I felt I needed to pee again, but I told myself to get through the first 4 miles and see if it went away like it has always done previously when I've race, and it did.\n\nIt was going to be a very hot day, that was obvious at 9am when we the start klaxon sounded, in these situations I always consider myself grateful that I can be normally be finished before the peak temperatures hit.\n\nIt wasn't too congested at the start and I managed to settle into a nice pace and sneak a little bit of time under my target before tackling the first big hill\n\nI got a big lift seeing my amazing wife a few miles in. We had joked that if I got a sub-3 that I would buy a PS5, and having enjoyed playing AstroBot in a store demo, she had bought the game for me and was waving it frantically as I passed, a great moment.\n\nThe crowds were very good at the start, but it was also nice to have quieter moments of the course, particularly in the beautiful scenery that was on display for the first hill climb. As I got to the top of the first big climb I was gaining confidence due to consistently hitting my splits and even snatching a few extra seconds while feeling great. At the top of the hill I was over 2mins under my required time.\n\nThe feared steep decline came next. Painfully the heel of my VaporFlys dug into my achillis as I ran down the steep decline but I managed to only lose 20\" (5:55 instead of 5:35) which I was really happy with. I managed to pass a big sub-3hr pace group for the starting pack in front of me, so that was nice knowing they would have to pass as well as the sub-3 pace group from my starting pen if I wasn't to get the sub-3. With the first hill over, this was the first time I thought to myself 'this is on here today.'\n\nI again saw my amazing wife at the Otley cheer point. I'd feared I'd missed her as she was standing after the main crowds, but it was fantastic positioning from her as we could see each other for around 150m as I ran towards her. This was a great time for a lift as the temperature rising was and I was about to hit the second massive hill.\n\nThe second hill was a gradual climb, not crazy steep but it last for 2 miles. I just kept telling myself to concentrate on the target split and run the mile that I was in. This the part where knowing my splits helped me most, I was happy to run in the mid 7's while I climbed. The fact was, with each mile I was getting more confident in achieving the sub-3 and was still over 2 minutes under my required time at around 18M. Getting to the top of the hill was another big tick in the process but now I had to face the dreaded final 6 miles of the marathon.\n\nAt this point the temperature was really beginning to ramp up, some kind residents were spraying the crowd down which helped. I'm glad to say though I really I don't think the heat effected my performance as much as I would have thought it would have though.\n\nAround 21Ms the full marathon joined up with the half marathon. I'd seen people write about this being a difficult part of the race on previous reviews, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite as congested as this. I'd estimate the half marathon runners were running at around a minute a mile slower so it was tough trying to weave around to pass them. If they want to have the half on the same day, I'm not sure what the solution is here to avoid hampering the marathon runners so much. I'm not sure it cost me more that 10-20\" but it's difficult to know, and I feel that it must have been worse for the marathon runners behind me if they were coming up against half-runners going at an even slower pace.\n\nThe crowds though were phenomenal at this part of the race, I hadn't experienced continuous wall-to-wall noise like that since running London. I guess that's the advantage of it being a beautiful and hot day.\n\nI have to say despite the congestion it felt like the last 4M went by really quickly. Despite having a sizeable amount of time in the bank I was still weary that the wheels can come off at any time in the last part of the marathon, and I lost a lot of time in London 2022 when I hit the wall. It probably wasn't until the last mile, still with over 2 minutes in hand I really thought for certain I'd cracked the sub-3. I took a moment to really enjoy the crowds and what I was about to achieve in this final mile, running a sub-3 seemed a long way off even a year ago, so to do it on this course, in this weather was something I was unbelievably proud of.\n\nI crossed the finish line to record a time of 2:57:48, a seven minute PB from Amsterdam 6 months ago.\n\n# Post-race\n\nThe finish was inside Headingley stadium, a really nice touch, with the stadium packed out. I would say the flow could have been managed a bit better, it took 5-10 minutes to get out and into the shade and this was actually where I was really feeling the heat the most. A Great medal and a nice t-shirt too.\n\nRidiculously, I realised I hadn't planned where to meet my wife after the race, and had left me phone with her, so I'd like to thank a kind stranger let me borrow her phone to ring her and I found her near where I'd left her at the entrance of the stadium.\n\nToday I sit writing this with DOMS hammering my legs, but over the moon with what I've done on Sunday, and while I'm looking forward to a break, playing my new PS5 and enjoying the summer. I am also looking forward to Valencia in December and attempting to grab a BQ at that one.\n\nThanks for reading, any questions about the race please let me know :)\n\nTL;DR Overall I'd say this was a really enjoyable race on a challenging course. The scenery is amazing, the crowds in the final 6M's are unbelievable. Though it is my opinion that the the full marathon joining up with the half is definitely something that should be managed better and would have cost the marathon runners time.",

However, the most important think is to recognize the signs of [heat exhaustion](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#exhaustion) and [heat stroke](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatrelillness.html#stroke) and not to try to be tough.  If you're running alone and you push into heat exhaustion, you have to stop immediately before you hit heat stroke.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion:\n\n* Confusion\n* Dizziness (good indictor no matter what, but more so when it's summer)\n* Fatigue (more so than usual)\n* Headache\n* Muscle/abdominal cramps\n* Nausea/vomiting\n* Pale skin\n* Profuse sweating\n* Rapid heartbeat\n\nHeat stroke is what heat exhaustion will turn into if you don't recognize it and stop immediately.  Signs of heat stroke are fairly similar but one notable difference is **that you have stopped sweating**.  Heat stroke is a serious medical condition and requires emergency treatment.  Call 911!\n\nSymptoms of heat stroke include:\n\n* Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech\n* Loss of consciousness (coma)\n* Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating\n* Seizures\n* Very high body temperature\n* Fatal if treatment delayed\n\nRemember that SLOW DOWN is never the wrong answer in the heat.  You're going to go slower - it's just a fact.  Embrace it and the fitness will still be there when the weather cools off.\n\nSome quick high level tips:\n\n* Run slower (duh)\n* Don't run during the heat of the day\n* Run in shaded areas.   Running in direct sunlight in the summer can add 20+ degrees to your skin temp, and that's what counts, not the air temp.\n* Avoid highly urbanized areas if at all possible during hot days.  The concrete jungle retains and radiates heat back at you, it is almost essentially an oven effect.\n* Focus on humidity as much as the temperature.  Understand how the mechanism of sweat works.  If the humidity is extremely high, sweat will just drip off you and not evaporate.  Evaporation of sweat is the mechanism of how the body cools itself - the phase change from liquid to vapor extracts heat from your skin.\n\nAnother good tip from a helpful Runnitor:\n\n>Dew point is actually a better measure of humidity than humidity percentage points are. That's because air at 100% humidity and 50F holds less water than air at 50% humidity and 90F.\n\n> You can use a dew point calculator to figure out the dew point. Over 65F dew point is sticky, but over 70F is very humid. Make sure to hydrate often and to pay attention to your body to see if it's overheating.\n\n> Here's a good dew point calculator:\n\n> http://dpcalc.org/\n\nFinally, one good table for pace adjustment is here:  http://maximumperformancerunning.blogspot.com/2013/07/temperature-dew-point.html?m=1\n\n**As a way to keep things a bit more organized and easier to find info later, I'm going to make several top level comments.  Please respond to those instead of the main post.  I'll include a stickied comment with direct links to each of the topic headings.  Other top level comments will be removed.**",

I just completed the Houston Marathon in 4:02 and I was looking for something to run just for fun. I had zero pace goals and I had just completed Pfitzinger 55/18 so I wanted to try something different. I used the Hanson's beginner plan and it worked out really well. I enjoyed the strength workouts and I did speedwork over a bridge (almost) every Tuesday for elevation practice. A normal 16 mile run for me in the swamps of Houston has 10ft of elevation so I used a bridge and 4 repetitions would get me about 150ft once a week. When I run this race again I will definitely add another bridge day. \n\n# Race\n\n This race was the most fun I have ever had running a marathon! It was my first time running off the roads and it was incredible! The weather was close to perfect (61F at the start, a cool breeze and 50F dewpoint) and the race was very well organized. There were only about 80 folks on the trails and I was alone for most of the race. The course had 1 big loop of about 10.5 miles that is run twice and a small loop for the last 5. The biggest climb is coming out of the start/finish line. I power hiked this every time. The trails were great for running-they were mostly dirt, flat rocks and a couple of sandy sections. I wore road shoes and was fine. \n\nThe scenery is nothing breathtaking but is constantly pretty. I saw flowering cactus, tons of wild flowers, the piney woods gave lots of shade and I loved the new growth in the forest fire area. The charcoal skeletons are almost completely covered with new growth and are really pretty. The sandy sections really were rough but they never lasted long enough to get angry about them. The back half of the big loop had some awesome rollers to fly down. \n\nI ran with the second place woman for a lot of the second loop and was feeling great until I tripped at mile 21 just before starting the sandstone loop. Miles 22-26 were awful. It was only 5 miles but it was so sandy and completely exposed to the sun. I pouted and complained and walked a bunch. If I had known how close I was to the 3rd place lady I might have run a bit more but I was throwing a pity party for myself. My kiddos and husband sent some sweet texts and I rebounded eventually. I ended up 4th lady overall and 13th of 38 runners. \n\nI brought a normal amount of gels but trail running is harder and takes longer so I should have had one extra. I started micro-dosing goldfish around mile 14 just to have something salty and space out my gels better. Also, I underestimated my ability to guestimate distances. On the road you can see the finish line or intersection from far away but in the woods you could be 15 feet from turn off and have no clue. I stopped about .1m before the sandstone turnoff to check google maps because I was convinced I had missed the very well marked and obvious turn, but at mile 23.5 I wasn't thinking straight. The aid stations were fully stocked with everything you could desire! The Gatorade slushies gave me a brain freeze every time and were my favorite! \n\nI had a great time and trail running is so different from road running! I can't wait to add more trails into my season this fall! Trails over Texas did a phenomenal job running this event and I am probably going to be running the winter Brazos Bend. \n\n  ",

I was drinking a 5th of Vodka daily as a minimum (it always ends with Vodka...) from 2022 until my detox. Prior to 2022, a 5th would last me around two days.I don't wish withdrawals on anybody and I still take Gabapentin daily to stave off alcohol cravings. During the detox, I decided that this was a second shot at having a productive life outside of just drinking, working and wondering how quickly I could end a work meeting so I could go have a drink.\n\nA few days after the withdrawal shakes went away and I finished my dose of Librium, I bought a Garmin Enduro 3, downloaded Strava, Carb Manager and started the work. I initially went out for runs at a pace of 11:54 min/mi. I utilized the run-walk method and quickly learned that it was going to take a lot to even finish a mile without feeling like I would have a panic attack and pass out.\n\nI started utilizing Garmins Daily Suggested Workouts at the end of November for a duration of 14 weeks. I found that the Daily Suggested workouts of base building were extremely helpful as a (once again) beginner and in November I ran a total of 8.6 miles. December 2024 - 77.2 miles, January 2025 - 84 miles, February 2025 - 115.8 miles, March 2025 - 145.9 miles, April - 144.6 miles.\u00a0\n\nIn November after a week of sobriety, I had found out that my bloodwork was just trash. My total cholesterol was 211 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides were 261 mg/dL (range is 0-150). These are just two of the metrics amongst others that were not looking good. My blood pressure upon waking was routinely 180/100 during the first few weeks of being sober. My blood pressure while being an alcoholic was even higher than this, pushing 190/120 on multiple occasions with a resting heart rate of 80-90 bpm. There was a long period of time during my addiction where I avoided doctors, hospitals, or really anywhere medical where a professional would put 2 and 2 together and call me out. This avoidance brought on immense anxiety which only made me drink more. There were multiple days at a time during the span of my addiction where I chose alcohol over food, even though I had food readily available. Mind you, this whole time, I held down a corporate 9-5 and lived in Downtown Chicago (shoutout to Streeterville). By the end of December 2024, I was in a 1000 calorie deficit/per day and tracking all of my calories via Carb Manager. My meals were pretty simple, breakfast consisted of eggs and beef sausages, lunches were always 85/15 ground turkey and dinners were a combination of healthy nuts with 90/10 ground beef. I averaged 1800 calories per day during the December 2024 - end of April 2025 timeframe. I went from 215LB on November 175th to 163lb as of this post, today. I most recently had bloodwork taken in February and my total cholesterol dropped down to 170 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides have dropped to 145 mg/dL (range is 0-150). As one could imagine, not only was I dropping weight and having better bloodwork, but I was feeling amazing and could not believe how much damage my body took and how it was actually able to bounce back. Nothing fits anymore.\n\nAs you can tell by my mileages above, I\u00a0*really*\u00a0got into running as a healthy addition to my sobriety (along with having a psychiatrist and going to Alcoholics Anonymous twice a week). I had no idea if I\u2019d ever race, but, in February a coworker had suggested that I sign up for the JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge 5K and I figured, why not? I had 10 weeks to get in a training block and I have coworkers that are extremely supportive and have run it every year. I started a 10 week training block with Garmin Coaching and I finally got in the speed-work that I had been avoiding during the first four months of returning to running. By the time I had started the 10 week training block, I was able to comfortably run up to 10 miles at a pace of 10:30 min/mi in Zone 2 with a HR range of 130-152 bpm. I was able to knock a few PR\u2019s that I was really happy with at the end of this 10 week block, including a 5:55 min/mile and a 5K time of 27:20.\u00a0I noticed that runs weren't necessarily easier but they felt easier. My pace would drop alongside my heartrate so I was getting faster and faster.\n\nThis block consisted of the following workouts per week;\n\nSunday (base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  \nMonday(threshold) : 1 mile WU, 20-40 min threshold, 1 mile CD  \nTuesday(rest): Active Rest Day (usually golfed a local 9 hole course or went to the driving range)  \nWednesday(V02 max): 1 mile WU, 10x 0.5 mile sprints at 177+ HR), 1 mile CD  \nThursday(base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  \nFriday(base): 1 mile WU, 8-10 mile base run, 1 mile CD  \nSaturday(long run): 10-15 mile base run\n\nI averaged around 35-40 miles per week with this training block and peaked at 47 miles. I cut out my calorie deficit in the last three weeks of the training block because I had already hit a weight that I was very happy with (170LB) and lesson learned, I was recovering much quicker due to eating maintenance calories. One week prior to my 5K, I PR\u2019d my mile time and hit 5:55 min/mile. I was ecstatic and had never run this fast before, even during my teen years when I was a skinny 140 LB kiddo. I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up this pace in the 5K but I knew that I could probably pull off 7:45-8:00 min/miles as long as I tapered correctly and didn\u2019t let the adrenaline consume me before the race.\u00a0\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nT-1 day. The anxiety is already setting in and my resting heart rate has gone from an average of 45bpm to 70bpm. During my last taper run, I tried imagining myself running with a crowd and I had a huge adrenaline dump and my HR went from 150bpm to 170bpm without increasing pace or effort. I knew that I had to accept the fact that no matter what happened during the race, I already came so FAR and if I decide to walk during the race, so be it.\n\nDay of race. I drove into work (Downtown Chicago) because I really did not want to spend over an hour in the train going back to the suburbs when I know I could drive back home in about 30 minutes. Felt pretty anxious all day but still managed to keep my routine. Had an easy breakfast with coffee and then had a chicken salad for lunch. Luckily the race was at 6:50PM which is near the time I usually go for runs so I was able to not divert too much away from the usual day. The end of the work day was spent with colleagues stopping by to wish me luck and telling me how happy they were to see me get ready for my first race.\n\nThe race was at 6:50pm so at 5:00pm, I changed into my REI half tights, pinned my bib to the awesome t-shirt provided by my company (I remember thinking this can\u2019t be happening right now), put on my Vaporfly 3\u2019s and headed to my car to drop off my work clothes. Once I dropped everything off, I headed to Grant Park to find my companies tent. \u201cIt\u2019s cold\u201d I thought as I walked to Grant Park. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to run so I can just get warm already\u201d. I walked leisurely to Grant Park (about a 15 minute walk from where I work) but my heart rate was already coasting around 130bpm and I knew I needed to just relax once I found the tent. Tent found, dropped off my stuff and chatted with some colleagues who have been lifetime runners. Excited, nervous, cold. I looked down at my green bib on my shirt and started making my way to the \u201cgreen corral\u201d. I was shocked at how many people there were.\u00a0\n\n**Race**\n\nRed corral just took off and I\u2019m finding that my heart rate has dropped to around 80bpm right before we start. I tell myself \u201chey, it\u2019s just another run. Remember to push it\u201d. The horn sounds and we go. It takes about 5 seconds between the sound of the horn and for the people directly in front of me (couple hundred people probably) to start moving. I hit \u201cstart\u201d on my watch and the timer begins. Holy shit people are running FAST. I am pushing it and I am being passed as if I were moving 3mph. I don\u2019t know much but I know that I don\u2019t want to cook myself in the first mile and then crash out. It IS a 3.5 mile race but I was really focused on my 5K time because I had a PR that I wanted to break. \u201cit\u2019s so cold\u201d and variations of that thought are what I am thinking about during the first half mile.\u00a0\n\nOne mile, 7:07 pace. I quickly glance down at my watch and I am surpassing the splits I thought I would have. \u201cAm I going too fast?\u201d. 1.5 miles in and I seriously consider stopping. My lungs are burning, the transition from being cold and shivering to sweating and running feels really weird. A loud crowd of runners suddenly turned into laser sharp focus, nothing but footsteps, heavy breathing and the occasional sound of a crowd cheering us on. About 2 miles in, we go under a bridge and the temp goes from 45F to probably 60F. \u201cOh wow, that feels amazing\u201d. I think about stopping again but I have too much momentum, quitting is absolutely not an option at this point unless I feel that I am going to be injured.\u00a0\n\n2 miles, pace 7:37. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve definitely slowed a bit but still doing good. I turn my music off because the sound of thousands of footsteps is so cool. This is not an every day thing and I don\u2019t get to experience this during my solo training runs. During this mile, we\u2019re passing on a portion of lower wacker drive and I can see the building I used live in during my time in Streeterville. I take a brief second to think about all of the physical falls I had in that apartment - from being absolutely wasted, to the daily dry-heaves before I left the apartment.\n\n3 miles, pace 6:02: Not much thinking going on at this point of the race. Making sure I continue breathing and don\u2019t trip over anyone. I pass up a lot of people and it. feels. good. \u201cHalf a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile left\u201d is the only thought I had until I hit 3.1 miles and\u00a0**PR\u2019d from 21:47 to 21:25**. I\u2019m ecstatic that I hit a PR, followed up with being mad that someone decided this race should be 3.**5**\u00a0miles.\u00a0\n\n3.5 miles; Official Time: 28:06.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI cross the finish line, grab a water and head to the company tent. My faster colleagues were already grabbing a snack as I was walking into the tent. My buddy PR\u2019d his 5K, with a time of 16:28. We celebrate and quickly start shivering due to being sweaty and the temp now having dropped even more as the sun went down. Cold is the keyword of the day. I feel nauseous and at one point I contemplate excusing myself to go see if I\u2019ll throw up. Luckily, I didn\u2019t throw up. As everyone is getting ready to leave and head to a bar that our company had rented out, I start the 15 minute walk back to my car to drive home.\n\nA few lessons learned.\n\n1. Moving forward, I will not be in a calorie deficit while in a training block. Recovery is slowed and injury risk rises.\u00a0\n2. Racing has me hooked.\u00a0\n3. I\u2019m proud of myself for not leaving any gas in the tank (especially when it came to that last mile).\n4. I need to pace myself better. I feel like running my 2nd mile at 7:37 and then running my last mile at 6:02 shows that I have improvement to make when it comes to pacing. I spent minimal time looking at my watch and tried my best to run by effort however it\u2019s pretty clear that I cooked a bit too much in my first mile.\n\nI just bought \u201cDaniels Running Formula\u201d and I\u2019m hoping to start another 5K Training block in the next few days. Not 100% sure where I\u2019ll go from here but I know I want to race again, and soon.\u00a0\n\nHopefully this was an interesting read for some of you. To those that have/are struggling with addiction, you are not alone. Life is so much better without drugs/alcohol. For every 1 \u201cfun\u201d alcohol story, I have 100 stories of struggling and not having a good time. I know that I am a much better person when I am sober, for myself and those around me.\n\nI wake up every morning with the same mantra; I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be sober tomorrow, but I\u2019ll do everything I can to stay sober today.\u00a0\n\nCheers.\n\nMade with a new\u00a0[race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)\u00a0created by\u00a0[u/herumph](/user/herumph/).\n",

I PB'd in the 10k in December (just over 37 minutes) and ran a 45k trail race in about 6 hours. I signed up for Eugene in January and officially started training for it in the new year.\n\nI took advantage of a promo to get a gait analysis done. A physiotherapist observed me running on a treadmill. She identified that I was overstriding a bit and landing on my heel, and that I was leaning back a bit. She gave me tips to lean forward and try to land closer to my body. I did a follow-up a month later and my form seemed to have improved. I can feel it when I\u2019m running too. Leaning forward feels more efficient, but when things get tough I have a habit of reverting back to my old ways. I have made improvements on that front, though. Towards the end of the training block, I actually also experimented with lifting my heels and landing more on the front of the foot, and I could tell that my legs liked the feeling of that a lot more. I felt a lot more fast and efficient, but I also knew that forcing a gait change isn\u2019t a good idea in the short-term, so that\u2019s something I\u2019ll play around with this summer to see if that\u2019s something I can naturally develop. \n\nMy original intention was to give it a solid effort to break 3 hours with hopefully better weather than TCS, but I didn't put too much pressure on myself to train too hard for it throughout the winter and let myself cross-train by swimming and playing volleyball while it was snowy outside. I ended up running a lot more than expected through the harsh conditions, and had a blast doing so. I think the mental training that came out of running through blizzards and doing long runs in a downpour while on vacation in Portugal really helped build my confidence in being able to manage discomfort.\n\nAt the beginning of the training block, I did a fair bit of workouts on the treadmill. My club's training plan started off with a block of high intensity efforts, and I found that doing intense efforts when it was below freezing triggered bronchospasm. I saw a doctor and ended up needing an inhaler to get over that issue. I decided to do treadmill workouts for a month or two. If I had to run fast outside, I would wear a mask to keep cold air from getting in my lungs. It wasn't until late February that I started doing workouts outside again.\n\nAs part of the training block, there were a few tune-up races I did:\n\n* A half marathon in the first weekend of March which I ran on a particularly cold day (9\u2109) in tempo shoes and wearing a mask the whole time in 1:25.\n* A ~6.8k relay leg in mid-March which I managed to run in Kinvaras at around 3:43/km, 5:58/mi pace.\n* A 30K where I just ran about 17 or so K at target marathon pace. It was a cold and rainy day and I wore NB Propels, which wasn't great for my knees in the end.\n\nI had the opportunity to get my VO2Max tested as part of a promotion. During the test, they measured oxygen flow through my muscles and my respiration. They had me run on a treadmill at an increasing pace and eventually incline until I stopped. I didn\u2019t want to push too hard on the treadmill because my legs were starting to hurt and I certainly didn\u2019t want to strain anything during the test, so I stopped. The end results were that my VO2Max was high, but my aerobic threshold was low, so that\u2019s the biggest area of improvement for me. Another thing that came up during the test was that my respiration rate at aerobic and tempo zones was way too low. I explained to the doctor that I deliberately slowed my breath down with the logic that it would help my body relax like in yoga, and he told me to stop doing that immediately lol. I took that advice moving forward, and over the summer I\u2019ll try to increase my mileage to get my aerobic threshold to improve. Overall, my mileage for this block wasn\u2019t too high, peaking at 53 miles in one week, which is under 90k.\n\nI didn't have any injuries, but some minor issues during the block. My adductor would sometimes flare up in the beginning of the year, and that's an issue I've had before. My right achilles would also feel sore after runs in the beginning as well. My right knee often bothered me. I went to PT to make sure nothing was wrong, and I was given exercises to address all of those concerns. I did them pretty consistently (and need to get back into it), but found that all the exercises really helped. I don't really feel pain in my adductors anymore: just soreness sometimes.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nI planned a two-week solo trip to the Pacific Northwest as part of this race. My company has offices in Seattle and Portland so I worked out of those offices during my stay. \n\nThe Tuesday before race day, I had an 8am flight to Chicago (I grew up in the area). I screwed up the morning and didn't get on the train to the airport until 6:30. After it arrived at the airport, I dashed in my boots to the Air Canada kiosk to check in (online check-in wouldn't work). Thankfully the employee was able to do it despite it only being 61 minutes before departure. I got on my flight and arrived around 9am. I took the CTA to the city to eat breakfast, work at my company's office and meet high school friends for lunch. I also had a contact who could do my nails at a cheap rate so I got them painted green in preparation for Eugene. I also stopped by Do Rite Donuts to get some gluten free doughnuts to begin my carbo loading for the week.\n\nMy flight to Seattle was in the evening. I had dinner in the city and took the train back to the airport. I arrived in Seattle before 11pm, so I was able to take the Light Rail into the city. It took an extra 15-20 minutes because of construction, but I got to the hostel I was staying in around midnight near Pike's Place. Over the next few days, I did my runs in Seattle, worked from my company's office there, and used their facilities (there was a sauna in the office which is insane and I took advantage of that every day I was there). I think I did too much walking while I was in Seattle and think I should have used the Lime bikeshare system more than I did, but I was being stingy with my money. I walked over 33k and 22k steps every day I was in Seattle with many of that happening with my work laptop, charger, running shoes, and change of clothes on my back.\n\nI got a massage on Wednesday, and it was quite deep. My calves were in pain during the massage and slightly after. I applied some ice to my right calf while working, and I was still feeling a bit tight on my run the next morning, but I could tell things were loosening up. On said run Thursday morning, I kept it short, but ran 10 minutes at what felt like marathon pace. This ended up being around 6:35-40, but it was in my Novablasts. I also accounted for the fact that I was still sore from the massage the previous day.\n\nOn Friday, I took the 7am Amtrak train to Eugene. The station was a 20 minute walk from my hostel in Seattle, and the ride was pleasant. The train was full of runners. After arriving in Eugene, it was a 20 minute walk from the train station to my AirBnB. I walked my bags there and then walked back downtown to get my bib and have food (I probably should have biked or taken a bus). I ended up having a gluten free sandwich at Eugene Burger Company because they were very good at accommodating my restrictions. I felt bad about eating meat since I try not to, but their GF crispy chicken was very good, it came with a lot of fries, and they have certified gluten free Blue cheese, which I'd never had. After this meal, I ended up walking way too much to go to a grocery store to pick up cream of buckwheat, soy milk, and cookies. I didn't go out for dinner because my late lunch was very filling. I walked 14k steps on this day. Not too bad but I could feel the fatigue from walking.\n\nI signed up for the 5k happening on Saturday morning with the intention of using it as a shakeout and practice run. I microwaved the cream of buckwheat in some water in the microwave and then added soy milk, a pinch of salt, and honey to it as well. To be honest this was a pretty sad breakfast, but not terrible for quick stays. Hard to beat the porridge I can make at home with my instant pot and fresh fruits, nuts, and seeds. I took a bike to the start line and was able to get there in under 10 minutes. This was a good opportunity to learn how to use the bikeshare system and figure out where to park. I ended up being 45 minutes early for what I was treating as a shakeout so I just hung around and chatted a bit. I saw a woman stretching who had a CGM on her arm so I tried to start a conversation by calling her a fellow diabetic: turns out she wasn\u2019t diabetic, just interested in health stats lol. But we still had a nice chat; she intends to run a marathon in every state. I forgot what number she was at but she clearly had a lot of marathon running experience. \n\nI wasn\u2019t too serious about getting into a corral for the run since it was just a shakeout for me, but this was a mistake because I ended up starting with people who signed up to walk the thing. It probably took 500m of very slow running before I was able to make it to the sidewalk and get ahead a bit more. There was another person with me in the same predicament; he was a British man living in New Mexico who was also doing this as a shakeout. He was smart and he used the bikeshare system to check out points of the course the day before. In hindsight, I wish I had done that. Less than a mile into the 5k, I saw a young-looking woman puking on the side of the road. It sucked to see that so soon into a 5k; I guess she hadn\u2019t seen the episode of the Office where Michael didn\u2019t carbo-load for the charity 5k properly :/. I picked up the pace to do some strides towards the end of the run. We finished at Hayward Field ~~Park~~, so that was a good preview for what was to come. I visualized finishing the marathon and running on this same track. After finishing, I got my goodie bag and picked up some gluten free pancakes to continue my carb loading. I then biked back to my accommodation to shower. \n\nI biked back downtown to visit a gluten free bakery that was only open on Saturdays to pick up an amazing brownie and some bread rolls to snack on. I walked through the Saturday outdoors market and felt sad that I couldn\u2019t spend more of the day walking around and spending time at each of the neat tents they had there. I went back to Eugene Burger Company for lunch. I preemptively took enough insulin for 180g of carbs because I was having a lot of problems with my blood sugar going high. I took this dosage over half an hour before having the sandwich and fries, and then brownie. I biked back to my accommodation and had some cookies. My blood sugar spiked shortly after this (mostly from lunch, but the cookies didn\u2019t help). I tried to nap for about an hour. It took a few hours for my blood sugar levels to stabilize before I went out for dinner at Jazzy Ladies for some pasta. Again, I tried to take a high dosage of insulin well before eating. I ended up at about 18k steps for the day.\n\nThis time, when I got back to my accommodation, my blood sugar was reading low, and I kept getting alerts saying I needed to eat sugar, but I knew to ignore it because the pasta was going to cause a spike. This is extremely annoying, but it\u2019s a very regular occurrence for me. My devices will beep at me for an hour straight telling me I need to urgently consume some sugar, I will keep having to silence them only for them to beep again a few minutes later, and then my blood sugar will end up spiking too high because whatever I ate a while ago is now being processed. This happened the night before the race where the whole evening I was getting alerts about being too low, but I knew it was going to spike. I wanted to avoid eating too much, but I also did NOT want to get woken up in the middle of the night with lows, so I ended up eating a bit of candy hoping that would prevent that from happening before I slept around 8 or 9pm. I think this was a mistake because my overnight sugar ended up being pretty high (between 10-14, or 180-252), so I didn\u2019t get the best rest and I woke up feeling a bit nauseated and groggy.\n\n### Race\n\nI woke up around 4:15 in anticipation of a 7am start to the race. I had my sad beige buckwheat porridge and some coffee as well. I got everything ready the night before; I had my race belt with bib and six gels (4 Maurtens, one Huma+, and one ginger-flavoured Brixa), my pre-race snack (GF Honey Stinger Waffle), a water bottle with some table salt and honey mixed in that I would sip on that morning and while warming up, and my Saucony Endorphin Elite 2s in my drop-bag to switch into after my warm-up. I did some PT exercises in my room with a band to activate my glutes and adductors. As is tradition, I peed at least 5 times before leaving around 6:10am. It took me 10 minutes to bike to the start area. There, I did some PT for my knee and jogged around for a bit in my trainers before doing some dynamic stretching, using the porta-potty one last time, then switching into my race shoes and checking in my bag. \n\nI had about half an hour to spare. I got to the start corral and found the 2:55 pacer not too far from the front of the pack. I intended to try and stick with him for the first quarter of the race and see how I was feeling. About 15 minutes before gun time I had my waffle and disposed of the wrapper. Overall I was feeling not my best because of all the blood sugar issues, and I could tell that I was on my feet too much over the past week because I felt the fatigue in my legs, but I also didn\u2019t feel too bad like I did in Vancouver last year. I felt that at least sub-3 should be possible. My blood sugar was around 8 or 9 and looked like it was going up a bit, which was perfect.\n\n#### Miles 0-3 (19:53)\n\nWtf, why is the 2:55 pacer going so fast? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nMy goal for the race was to aim for at least 6:40/mile pace, but aim for 6:30 if I felt good to hit my A goal. It was a pretty crowded start and probably the hottest I\u2019ve felt at the beginning of a marathon in a while. I felt like I was going too fast but the 2:55 pacer was way ahead of me. There were a bit of rolling hills in the beginning of the course, so I wasn\u2019t expecting too consistent of a pace to start with, but after a few minutes and some elbow brushes with those around me, I had to give up and run my own race. This was unfortunately pretty disheartening, but I tried to tell myself that the pacer was going too fast (others around me felt the same way), and that my pace was fine. I did feel nervous though because I felt like the pace was a bit hot, and my expectation was that the first half of the marathon shouldn\u2019t feel too difficult.\n\nAt around the 3 mile mark, the crowd thinned out a tiny bit, but there were still so many people at my pace. I knew going in that this was a fast race, and I think having so many people run sub-3 made it easier for me, whereas I don\u2019t know how it would have felt at a slower race. I had Gatorade at almost all of the aid stations to keep my blood sugar levels high and to overcompensate for the fact that I felt like I would run a bit hot. I knew not to put too much pressure on myself in terms of heart rate, but I wanted to keep it under 160 for the first half if possible. It looks like I was able to do that for the most part. I did get nervous because right before the 3 mile marker, I felt a bit of sweat on my forehead. I worried that maybe it meant I was going too fast. My blood sugar was still around 9, and I tried to relax my body as much as possible and not push the pace too hard.\n\n#### Miles 3-6 (20:02)\n\nI believe at this point of the race, things were a bit quiet, but there were still cool moments. We passed two musicians with a banjo and guitar singing about marathon runners at one of the empty parts of the course. I heard some folks around me talk about how they were going for 2:55 so I ran around them for a bit. I checked my watch often to see what my pace was because I wanted to have as much buffer below 6:40/mile as possible without pushing myself too hard, and I also wanted to get as close to 20 minutes per 3 mile split as possible.\n\nThere was a woman in a green singlet well in front of me who had gels in pockets at the back of her singlet. I heard some of her friends make jokes about how they were just community gels that were up for grabs for anyone. Speaking of which, around 4.5 miles in is when I took my first Maurten gel, as I wanted to take one every half hour. My blood sugar levels were still around 9 or 10. It may have gone a bit high with that plus the gatorade, but I didn\u2019t worry as I could tell it would drop soon. \n\n#### Miles 6-9 (20:01)\n\nIt was a gentle downhill for most of this leg. One highlight includes a guy who had an inflatable Trump punching bag that he brought to this section after having it available near the start too. The only aspect of this part of the race I remember is that after an aid station towards the end of it where I had some Gatorade, we had a sizable hill to climb (not too long) before going downhill again and making our way back to Hayward Field. On the uphill, I ended up catching up to the woman in the green singlet. We ran at a similar pace for a bit.\n\n#### Miles 9-12 (20:12)\n\nI saw from some peoples\u2019 posts that there was a therapy Llama here? I completely missed it! (I ended up encountering a therapy Llama at Pioneer Square in Portland later that week so it\u2019s all good.) \n\nAs we were crossing the Start Line going the opposite way, the crowds were pretty dense. On the other side of the road we could start to see the finishers for the half marathon looking strong. I had either another Maurten gel here, or my Huma+ gel.\n\n#### Miles 12-15 (19:41)\n\nAs we crossed the bridge into Springfield, reality started to set in with respect to my goals. The race was almost halfway over, and I was going to cross the halfway point at well over 1:25. To my left I could start to see runners ahead of me, but I didn\u2019t know how far ahead they were as I didn\u2019t study the course. Feeling motivated and perhaps coping, I tried to push the pace a little bit in mile 13 because I mentally wanted to be well under 1:27:30 for the halfway point. Even if I accepted that 2:55 would be my goal for the race, I wasn\u2019t comfortable with not having much buffer.\n\nThe turn-around point was a bit after mile 12. I could see runners ahead of me and noticed a man wearing a button-down shirt. Instantly felt self-conscious over the fact that I was worried about overheating in my singlet and half-tights. Thankfully, shortly after turning around, I passed that runner and stayed ahead of them. It would have been demotivating to look at them ahead of me for much longer.\n\nI don\u2019t recall quite what my half marathon split ended up being, but I remember not being thrilled about not having enough of a buffer. I felt pressure that I had to be very careful not to push myself too hard and to make sure I was getting enough electrolytes and fuel to avoid any cramps. At this point there were no major concerns. I just felt that the run was a bit tiring and I was mostly worried about reaching my limit at some point. Around 13.5 miles in, instead of having a gel, I had an Awake chocolate bite. None of my gels had caffeine and even though I\u2019m skeptical of it having any effect on me, I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to have some during the race. Besides, a little chocolate was a nice treat where I\u2019ve otherwise just had gels and Gatorade.\n\nThis part of the course took us through some suburban neighborhoods and then into an asphalt trail with a field of tall grass. There were two kids in their late teens/early 20s running besides each other having a very casual conversation. They both seemed very relaxed, which made me feel a bit self-conscious about how I felt like I was trying hard, but it also made me feel motivated. I ended up unintentionally eavesdropping on their conversation about university, their experience in Oregon, and choosing majors between CompSci and Finance. I heard loud footsteps approaching from behind me; I moved to the side and waved them in. Turns out it was the woman in the green singlet again. She may have slowed down during an aid station to properly take in fluids before speeding back up. I couldn\u2019t keep up, but I stayed with the younger pair for the rest of the leg.\n\n#### Miles 15-18 (19:55)\n\nOne of the young lads pushed on ahead while the other stayed at my pace. We fist bumped as he moved ahead too eventually. There were lots of beautiful tree-lined trails in this section which I unfortunately wasn\u2019t able to fully appreciate due to the fact that I was locked in, listening to my body, and paying attention to my watch. Throughout the race, my right ankle was experiencing some soreness, but nothing too alarming.\n\nAround mile 16 or 17, I started feeling a bit of tightness in my right hamstring and adductor, but it didn\u2019t last too long. It made me paranoid about whether or not I would be able to hold on. Doing the math on how much of the race was left (10 miles and some change), I calculated what would happen if something gave out and I had to run 8 minute miles for the rest of the race. It would no longer be a sub-3. I didn\u2019t feel bad enough to have to slow down so I thought that I just needed to hold on for a few more miles in order to achieve enough buffer for a sub-3. \n\nAt this point, I knew that my 2:50 goal was out of reach. I would have to push the pace a lot in order to make that a reality. It might be possible, but it\u2019s also a risk I wasn\u2019t comfortable with. Maybe I push myself to shave off a couple of minutes: in the best case scenario, I succeed, but won\u2019t even have enough buffer for a BQ. In the worst case scenario, I could sabotage the race and not even end up going sub-3 let alone PB\u2019ing. I chose to play it safe.\n\nBecause I was afraid of cramping, I took my Brixa ginger gel towards the end of this leg since I believe it had higher sodium content than the Maurten gels.\n\n#### Miles 18-21 (19:49)\n\nAfter mile 20, it became a matter of running one more 10k. I was a little bit over 2 hours at this point and I thought about how I had to run in the low 40s just to barely get under 2:55. I still felt strong and wasn\u2019t worried about hitting a wall.\n\nShortly after mile 20, I caught up to the woman in the green singlet once again. This time, she started a conversation by pointing out that we met again. I asked about her goal, which was anything under 3 hours, and I told her that my original 2:50 goal was out of reach, but that I wanted to aim for under 2:55. We ran together for about 10-20 seconds, gave each other words of encouragement about being able to hit our goals, and I sped ahead. The words of encouragement helped me feel better about the rest of the race, and in a matter of minutes, I could see the 2:55 pacer off in the distance. At first they seemed far away and I assumed they would stay ahead since they were going pretty fast and the pack was looking pretty strong, but little by little I kept creeping up.\n\nI started with the goal of just catching up to the group, and it probably took me about 5 minutes to do so. If I recall correctly, there may have been some casualties along the way. I believe it was right before the 21 mile marker when I finally caught up. Catching up to them was a huge confidence boost for me. At the beginning of the race, I had just assumed the 2:55 pacer was gone for good. I\u2019m not sure if they had a positive split; I know mine was negative, but I didn\u2019t think it was *that negative* that I would get so far ahead that I would catch up to a group that I couldn\u2019t see the whole race. As I was passing the group, I heard the pacer say that he knew what everyone was feeling, and that his hip flexors were hurting too. \n\nIt was a bit early, but I went ahead and ate my 5th gel, which was Maurten. With under 10k left, and with gels taking 15-30 minutes to really make a difference, I figured that delaying it any longer would make it pointless to have another. I still had one more after this; I figure the caffeine chocolate I had at the halfway point and the Gatorade throughout the course provided enough carbs such that I didn\u2019t need a 6th gel.\n\nWith the pacer behind me, I felt strong. My legs still felt tight once in a while but it was perfectly manageable, and not nearly as bad as some of the training sessions I\u2019d been through this season. There were some disheartening moments for sure: I saw a few women recovering from puking and struggling to get started again, lots of runners suddenly having to stop to stretch, and some runners who kept going but slowing down and looking like they were in pain from their strides. \n\nI tried not to put too much weight on those observations and kept on; I do a lot of running solo with no music so the quiet parts as we approached the turnaround were no problem for me. There were some memorable moments, like a marching band that was playing as we passed. There was a pair of signs saying \u201cDamn, are those Sauconys?\u201d followed by \u201cSaucon-deez nuts!\u201d As I was wearing Endorphin Elite 2s, I gave those folks a shout-out.\n\nAt the end of this leg was a turnaround, which involved going up a curved incline to reach a bridge. It felt a bit tough this late in the race but I was able to get up without anything going wrong thankfully. From here it was just 5.2 miles left back to Hayward Field.\n\n#### Miles 21-24 (19:27)\n\nThis part of the race went by very fast. I was feeling the runner\u2019s high and was going faster than I was at any other point of the race so far. There were well under 40 minutes left and I knew I could manage the pain for that long pretty easily. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really show on the course profile much but it felt like there were a lot of undulating little hills in this section. It didn\u2019t affect my pace, but I had to pay enough attention to my form to accommodate. It was hard to maintain pace and drink Gatorade so I did a quick power walk at the aid station to sip and got right back running.\n\n#### Miles 24-Finish (14:05, 19:12 equivalent for 3 miles)\n\nFinal stretch and still going strong! I felt good about how much of a buffer I had under 2:55. I didn\u2019t have pressure about trying to hit 2:50, and at this point whatever time I could cut down was extra credit. \n\nWhen I made the final turn with less than a mile left, I tried speeding up as much as I could without feeling like I would strain anything. I crossed through a park with curvy sidewalks. A spectator started encouraging me to catch up to the person in front of me. Throughout this entire section I was passing people. In hindsight, I think I had too much energy here. We eventually merged with half marathoners who were still running, but were still separated by cones. I thought about how this was the section where I saw the top half marathoners finish almost two hours ago, and now it was my turn.\n\nAs I turned onto the track at Hayward Field ~~Park~~, just like I had in the 5k the previous day, I heard the announcer commend all of the marathon runners who were doing their best to get under 3 hours. I found this odd since it was still a few minutes below 2:55 and I figured he would highlight the BQ timing, but that\u2019s a nit-pick! As I turned the final curve and went for the finish line, I was humbled by a dad in front of me who picked up his daughter from the crowd and jogged to the finish. Hoping to get a good finisher photo I hit a pose as I crossed the line and the clock read 2:53:22.\n\n### Post-race\n\nRight after crossing the line, I felt a bit disappointed. Obviously I was happy it was over; I hit a huge milestone with a technical BQ, and I could stop worrying about all the things that could go wrong in the race. However, I still had a lot of energy left. I felt like I could probably maintain a fast pace for another mile or two. My immediate thoughts were that I didn\u2019t give it my all, that I may have run too conservatively, and that I spent too much time on my feet over the last few days. I think there was a part of me that was also just sad that it was over because it was such a fun race and I wanted to keep going and pushing myself.\n\nStill, I was happy that nothing went wrong. I hit my B goal. I didn\u2019t have any digestive issues or feel sick. My blood sugar was cooperative for the first 20 miles (my glucose sensor stopped reading after that point. The Dexcom G7 is pretty unreliable but the fact that it worked for the first 20 miles was a miracle tbh). I have room for improvement for my next marathon because I know I can go faster, although it\u2019ll be hard to beat the course profile and weather.\n\nI slowly walked through the chute to get my goodie bag with a banana, bagel and cookie. I tried pretty hard to get someone to take my bagel and cookie since I can\u2019t eat gluten but eventually gave up because no one wanted it. I wasn\u2019t a fan of how the goodie bags were handed to us with goodies already inside, especially because the bagel was bare and touching everything else.\n\nI sipped on the water bottle they gave us and ate the banana. It felt like a long walk to bag check, where I had to wait in line for a long time. It may have been 15-20 minutes of waiting in line before I got my bag. After I finally got my bag, I put on the jacket I had in there and switched back into my Novablasts. I slowly walked over to the water station to refill my water bottle and walked upstairs to get my gluten free pancakes. The pre-race guide we got said that there would be grilled cheese sandwiches, and that section mentioned \u201ctry our gluten free bread,\u201d so I thought there would be gluten free grilled cheese. Sadly, I asked the folks at the Franz food truck if they had any gluten free bread and they said no. Not a big deal because I was happy to have pancakes at least.\n\nI got my pancakes and leaned against a wall to eat them. I was scared of sitting down because I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to get up. After that, I took a selfie with my three medals with Hayward Field in the background, refilled my bottle, and headed towards the exit. \n\nThere was some confusion on shuttle buses at the exit. I asked a volunteer where I could go to catch one: the shuttle buses went downtown so I intended to grab brunch at Jazzy Ladies before biking or walking back to my accommodation. The volunteer told me to go to the cemetery, but after I walked up a hill to get there, there were no signs of a shuttle. I walked around a bit and found a group of people walking away from me. I asked if they were going to the shuttle and they said they thought so. I decided to follow them for a bit until I saw a woman look like she was waiting as well. When I asked her about it, I found out that we both talked to the same volunteer. We both decided to keep following this group.\n\nEventually, while the group was in front of us, I looked to my right and saw what looked like a crowd of people waiting for a bus. Apparently the source of confusion was because one of the last shuttles to the start was cutting it close to the start time, so runners on the bus asked to get off by the cemetery. For this reason, some volunteers thought this was a shuttle stop.\n\nThere was already a big group of people here waiting for the shuttle, and I heard a volunteer say that after one shuttle is full, the next one will be 10-15 minutes. There was also no line-up: people just crowded up until the shuttle arrived so it didn\u2019t matter who was waiting for longer. Not wanting to be part of that chaos, I ended up just taking a bikeshare and biking back to my accommodation to shower.\n\nAfter resting a bit and eating a bread roll, I biked back downtown to go to Jazzy Ladies for brunch. Unfortunately, when I got there (2:30pm), they stopped accepting patrons for brunch and would re-open at 5 for dinner. I walked over to a fast-cas place called Cafe Yumm and got a rice bowl from there instead. It tasted a bit sweet, but it was still satisfying. I then had a few hours to kill in the city before dinner.\n\nI decided to go by the river and re-visit parts of the course since I wasn\u2019t able to appreciate it while I was running. I got a bit carried away and covered 9k on [my walk](https://www.strava.com/activities/14307940257), going around the river and hiking up Skinner Butte before heading back downtown. I finally had Polenta Lasagna for dinner before heading to Handel\u2019s Ice Cream at 5th Street Market to get my discounted ice cream for showing my medal. This place had long lines the whole afternoon. After dinner there was still a line going outside but it wasn\u2019t too bad: it probably took me 10 minutes to get my cup. The server was very helpful at confirming which flavours were gluten free and scooping a cup out of a fresh tub with a sanitized scoop.\n\nThe next day, I took Amtrak to Portland. I stayed there and had an amazing time in the city for the week to cap off my PNW trip. I really fell in love with the city. I spent a decent amount of time in the Arboretum and Forest Park trails, and I did a half-day trip to see waterfalls. I had so much amazing gluten free food in Portland and am sad that I didn\u2019t get to try all the places I wanted to. I ended the week by taking the train from there up to Vancouver, BC for a night before flying back to Toronto.\n\n#### Positives\n\nEugene Marathon was AMAZING! Highly recommended if you\u2019re in the states. Probably the best marathon I\u2019ve participated in all-around.\n\nThe city really gets taken over for the marathon. The train from Seattle was completely full because of it. 12,000 people participated in the event. Even though it\u2019s a small college town, the organization is top-notch and I never felt that crowds were much of an issue even with all those people. Maybe getting your bag after the race was the only slow part.\n\nThe course itself is beautiful, and did not have any difficult parts to dread. Crowd support was very good. Aid stations were well-managed and I appreciate that they offered Gatorade instead of Nuun since that helps take in carbs during the race. The weather was very good and it was refreshing to not deal with strong headwinds, which is something I experience a lot in Toronto.\n\nThe people I interacted with were mostly friendly. The reputation of this race brings out a lot of very strong runners. So many people ran sub-3, and having others to run with and compete with may have helped things for me. According to findmymarathon.com, 16.8% of finishers BQ\u2019d.\n\nThe gluten-free pancakes were much appreciated. One thing I didn\u2019t mention was that in the 5k, they have a male and female pancake participate in the race, and if you beat the one in your respective category, you get free pancake mix. It\u2019s too bad I had to save myself for the marathon because genuinely racing a pancake running a 17 minute 5k sounds really run.\n\nThe race being in the PNW makes it a really fun travel destination. The city is well-connected by transit to Portland and Seattle. The city itself is walkable, bikeable, and you can get by with the bus as well.\n\n#### Negatives\n\nThere aren\u2019t many negatives to talk about. I suppose the situation with the shuttle after the race was a bit annoying, but I was still able to get where I needed to go pretty quickly by bike.\n\nThe hotels that were in Eugene were very expensive. This makes sense considering the size of the town versus how many people were coming in for the race. I ended up having to book an AirBnB guesthouse to keep things reasonable for a single person. There were some cheaper options over in Springfield, but that\u2019s not as nice of a stay and would likely require a car or ride-hailing to get by. \n\n#### Future Plans\n\n* I have a 10k this Sunday, but it feels incredibly unlikely that I\u2019ll be able to race it. I really tired myself out after the race with my hike and all the exploring I did in Portland, which included a hike and a trail run. I stayed in hostels for the week after the race so I didn\u2019t get great rest. I arrived back in Toronto pretty late at night so I didn\u2019t sleep well, and haven\u2019t been sleeping well this whole week. I could use a post-trip vacation. I went on an easy run on the Wednesday before the 10k and it felt tough on the legs.\n* I am signed up for the Sulphur Springs 50k at the end of the month, but again, I\u2019ll have to decide next week if I want to run it. I planned to do it for completion and not try too hard during it, but if I am still recovering at that point, I am considering dropping to 20k. I was looking forward to running this with a friend, but that friend hurt her ankle and is likely not running, so that hurts the motivation to push myself here.\n* I want to work on my 5k and 10k times over the summer while also upping my easy pace mileage. I have one 10k and one 5k that I've signed up for so far. I\u2019m also signed up for a 100k casual bike ride, and a trail relay at Blue Mountain, ON. My friends and I are signed up for an Ekiden relay in June so I\u2019m excited to run that for the first time.\n* My fall plans are not set. I am signed up for P\u2019tit Train du Nord, but I may refund that registration. Hyrox Toronto is going to be the same weekend and I would like to participate in that. I am considering what other fall marathons can take its place. I am considering:\n * Georgina Marathon in early September\n * Niagara Falls Marathon in late October\n * M\u00e1laga Marathon in December\n * Which marathon I do will depend on whether or not I can convince others to join me so I\u2019m not going solo. It would be nice to break 2:50 and maybe even get closer to 2:45 if qualifying for Berlin is possible.\n* For next Spring, I\u2019ve signed up for the London lottery but probably won\u2019t get in. If not, I am considering other marathons in Europe. Namely:\n * Paris\n * Copenhagen\n * Zurich\n * Edinburgh\n * Rotterdam\n * I will also sign up for the Tokyo lottery. I\u2019ve never been to Japan. I may even pay for a tour or charity for Tokyo just because it would be the perfect excuse to finally travel there.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "* Male, 51\n* Started running 10 months ago.\n* First half marathon\n* Target a: 1h45\n* Target b: 1h49:16 pb (although that is just from a training run)\n* Target c: negative split\n* Result 1h45:02, negative split\n\n**Official Splits, all in kms**\n\n5km 24.53 (4:59 pace)\n\n10km 50.11 (25m18 for 5km, 5:03 pace)\n\n15km 1:14:10 (23m49 for 5km, 4:48 pace)\n\n21.1km 1:45:02 (4m58 pace overall)\n\n**Training**\n\nFollowed Garmin Coach HM plan, 18 weeks, coach Amy.\n\nWould not recommend this, did not seem to adapt, did not include any tempo runs, strides, and only 1 or 2 hill sessions. Did not adapt to my times. Had target pace of 6:00/km for most  \nruns. I understand you have to run easy for a lot of practise, but 6:00 felt slow given I was targeting 4:58 pace.\n\nThat said, I did train 4 x a week, and the plan did get me to my time goal I suppose! I generally  \nignored the 6:00 pace and went a bit faster in training. A typical month had me  \nrunning 125-150km at average pace of 5:15/km.\n\nThis was my first HM so the 1h45 time goal came from extrapolating from times in 5km and 10km races.\n\nIn training I think I did 3 HMs, 1:49; 1:56 and 2:05 maybe.\n\n**Taper**\n\nThe garmin plan had a taper with no runs in the 3 days prior, but I did a shake out run 2.5km the day  \nbefore, easy pace. Think that was good. After running 4x a week for months, going 3 whole days with nothing would have been odd.\n\n**Carb loading**\n\nAlthough I read a lot about this, I in fact didn't take it that seriously, I just ate a few more carbs than normal in last couple days. Didn't measure it. Would take it more seriously for a full marathon.\n\n**Race day**\n\nThought I might be real nervous as I'd be training a lot and thinking about the race a lot, but in fact  \nI wasn't nervous at all. Breakfast of muesli + yoghurt plus 1 slice toast with peanut butter and honey.The weather forecast was good, and it was a perfect day, 13-17 degrees, sunny. Warm enough not to need to take a jacket on the ferry on the way there. Got there plenty early and checked out the start, and got to my corral area very early, with an hour to kill.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nI had a running vest packing 1.25km water, 4 gels, 2 band aids and my phone. While that was 2kg of extra weight, I appreciated it as I did not have to stop in the chaos of water zones, and I didn\u2019t have to risk gels I\u2019d never tried before. So I\u2019d do that again, even though I reckon less than 5-10% people were doing same. Plan was to have one gel before start, and then 5,10 and 15km, which is what I stuck to and worked well.\n\n**The Corral**\n\nI got one of the last tickets to this race. And that meant I was in the last corral, for people expecting to do 2h15 and over. This being my first HM, I thought that could be a problem, but I also thought that as there was a 50 min gap between the start time of the previous corral, if I got to the front of mine, there might be some clear road ahead. That wasn\u2019t what happened at all, the previous corral and mine merged really, so just one big queue to get through the very narrow start, 2 people at a time. Still, I ended up starting 10 mins ahead of the official start time for the coral.\n\n**First 5km**\n\nAs my overall race pace was 4m58, and I was targeting a small negative split, I thought I\u2019d go out at 5m pace, and do first 5km in 25 mins. This was after my only other race when I went out way too hard (22m for 5km, and then hit the wall after 5km and finished in 45m47 for 10km). So key to settle in easy, keep heart rate low, and not let adrenaline get me carried away. That worked well, and did first 5km on pace, at 24m53.\n\nHowever, due to me being in a much slower pace group (and even the corral before was a 2-2h15 group), I spent the ENTIRE race, all 21.1km, weaving and overtaking. So in fact my Garmin reads that I ran 21.44km, an extra 340m of distance through weaving. My Garmin HM time therefore, is 1h43m25. So the weaving, primarily through being in wrong pace group, cost me 1.5 minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**5-10km**\n\nMy first concerns.\n\nIs that a blister coming? I\u2019d had one blister in training, in 10 months, but nevertheless I\u2019d put a pre-emptive band aid on that spot. Luckily, the concerns didn\u2019t materialize, no blisters.\n\nAre my nipples getting sore? I had no idea this was even a thing until recently reading race reports on here. I started to feel this 8km in. But again, it didn\u2019t eventuate.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just targeting getting to 10km in under 50 minutes and then seeing how I feel for second half negative split?\n\nAccording to my Garmin I was about 30 seconds ahead, but on race time, I found out afterwards I was 11seconds behind, again the difference being all the weaving I was doing.\n\nNote that I didn\u2019t see the km markers the whole way, only one I noticed was at 9km, so I was more plugged into garmin distance than hm distance \u2013 learning for next time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**10km-15km**\n\nFeeling ok at this point. Still weaving the whole time, \u201ccoming through on your right!\u201d\n\nEffort is starting to go up to keep same speed. In fact, this 5km was quickish at 23:59. Nice. So I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m well ahead of 1h45 pace BUT unaware that my weaving is actually making it line ball.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**15-20km**\n\nIt starts with the BIG HILL which I kept going on, no issues.\n\nMy Garmin tells me I did 15-20km, 5km, in 24m25, again ahead of 4m58 pace.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**20km up to finish.**\n\nThe official splits for some reason go from 19.6km to finish, and show 7m50 for 1.5km, which seems slow, but there are a couple hills in there. Garmin shows 6m43 for last 1.44km. (Remember, it thinks I ran 340m extra due to all the weaving). By the time I hit the last 300m I was flying and hit up to 3m20 pace right towards the line, so still felt strong.\n\nNegative split, I can say yes to that as first 10km official timing was at 5:01 pace, and overall pace was 4:58, so around 30 secs quicker for second half maybe?\n\nFelt actually ok at finish. Still feeling ok, not to sore, a few hours later.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Reflections**\n\nReally pleased to get first HM done, and hit target (give or take 2secs). I don\u2019t love crowds, so running with 20,000 people wasn\u2019t joyous for me, and the weaving was frustrating. So, will have to book early and get right corral next time. Literally the whole way was so busy. The training seemed to pay off, the nutrition and gel strategy, and taking my own water worked well. All the race reports I read on here helped think through and make plans.",

I\u2019ve completed a few ultras (two 50Ks), a trail marathon, and one road HM (1:38 PR), but this was my first road marathon.\n\nThis cycle, I wanted to challenge myself with speed and road-specific training. I didn\u2019t have the best sense of my MP since I had only run on quite hilly trails (4+ hr was my PR), but I estimated I could achieve a BQ of 3:25 based on last year\u2019s HM PR (1:38) and recent fitness gains.\n\n# Training\n\nI loosely followed the Pfitzinger 18/55 plan (18 week training cycle), though I had to adapt it heavily and shorten workouts due to work (10-hr shifts at the hospital) and life (puppy!). I peaked at 52 mpw, with most weeks in the 35\u201345 mile range. Body felt good with the higher mileage, and I mostly felt limited by time constraints. Long runs included two 20-milers and several 18\u201319 milers. Speedwork included strides, hill repeats, and tempo sessions. Weekend long runs were often on hilly trails or incorporated MP (7:30-40ish) on roads.\n\nStrength training dropped off in January, but I stayed consistent with Z2 aerobic volume, speedwork, and recovery. Had to cut short a lot of Pfitz\u2019s mid-week long runs, but still had markedly higher mileage than I was used to, even with two or three rest days per week. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t get injured and got sick only once (for three days).\n\nTraining was fun because I\u2019d never focused on road running before, so I PR\u2019d in everything this cycle: \n\u2022\t5K: 20:25 \n\u2022\t10K: 42:35 \n\u2022\t10 Mile: 1:11:xx\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI tapered aggressively over 3 weeks and only ran a couple of short shakeouts during race week. Slept well, hydrated heavily, carb-loaded with intention, and avoided alcohol the final week. Took two full rest days before the race (with lots of walking).\n\nRace morning: Woke at 5:45, had pancakes and oatmeal immediately and an oz coffee with cream. I had slept decently despite nerves. Missed my pre-race warm up/ shakeout because the event was so crowded!\n\n# Race day details\n\nWeather: Couldn\u2019t have been better\u2014coolish (50s), sunny, dry, low wind. \n\nCourse: Rolling hills early, flat and fast later, with beautiful scenery\u2014UBC forest, downtown, and the seawall.\n\nCrowds: WAY MORE than I\u2019m used to (trail runner here). The energy was awesome, though the start was chaotic. Collosal lines for the bathroom, so I had to squat behind the Porta in order to make it to my corral in time. (Sorry.) I was able to squeeze my way to the end of the first corral before the gun time.\n\nFuel: Took SIS isotonic gels every 30 minutes, starting 5 mins before the gun. No hydration pack; just sipped from water/electrolyte cups at every aid station (every ~3K).\n\nGear: Shorts with gel pockets. Shoes were Adizero Adios Pro 3s.\n\n# Race strategy\n\nFocused on easing into the first 3 miles due to bottlenecking and conserving energy by running tangents (as able). My goal pace was around 7:40/mile, while \"banking time\" on the downhills (7:00-7:20ish; not overdoing it, to save my quads) and easing the pace on the hills (primarily Camuson Street).  I could not find my 3:20/3:25 pacer, so I selected other runners periodically to pace behind, before eventually passing them once I had my big \"kick\" at the final 10k of the race! I was consistent with taking one gel per 30 min, and drank to thirst from aid stations every 3-5k or so (alternating between electrolytes and water). Since I felt strong by mile 10, I dialed up the pace and had negative splits the latter half of the race. No bathroom breaks!\n\n# Race recap\n\nWhat a glorious course! It was rolling with plenty of gradual uphill/downhills. The city itself is gorgeous, clean and modern, contrasting with the lush forests of UBC\u2019s campus and the mountain views along the Stanley Park seawall. Morale was high because of all the crowds of spectators throughout the whole course! Volunteers handed out cups of water and electrolyte juice every 3k or so.\n\nMiles 1-7: I started conservatively because of the hills and crowds in the beginning, but quickly realized I could handle a faster pace than my original target of 7:40-ish/mile. The biggest hill was the infamous Camosun (about 1.2k and 52 meters), which I\u2019d built up to be way worse in my head than it was! It was also early at mile 6, which helped to get it out of the way. \n\nMiles 8-14: Flat-ish, serene forests of Pacific Spirit Park and the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus, followed by about 3 miles of speedy downhill to the Kitsilano neighborhood! Picked up the pace here (including sub-7min mile). \n\nMiles 15-18: Started to feel the sun exposure here, but doggedly followed a lovely lady in front of me, who seemed to be pacing about 7:25-7:30/mile. Slight uphill at Burrard Bridge around mile 18 was manageable.\n\nMiles 19-24: The course was mostly flat on the latter half of the race, so by mile 20 (the seawall at Stanley Park) I felt it was safe to amp it up some gears! Fresh ocean air, mountain vistas, and few spectators made for a calm and focused headspace. Felt good to be passing people at this point, pushing under 7-min/mile, even with burning quads! My militant fueling massively helped with this \"kick\"; I had learned my lesson from my last 50k, in which I bonked massively from underfueling.\n\nMiles 25-26.5 (according to my watch!): Slight uphill through the streets of downtown to the finish line HURT, but I pushed with all my might at under 7-min/mile pace!\n\n#Post-race\nQuads are VERY SORE, but otherwise feeling good (joints, feet, etc.!) Will take it easy for a few weeks before easing back into base building for next year. \n\n#Takeaways/next steps\n\nOverall, it was a beautiful day and a gorgeous course. I was thrilled by my time (3:15, ten mins faster than my BQ goal), fueling, and surprising negative splits! (Though now I am wondering if I should\u2019ve started faster?) \n\nI am planning to take on Boston next year with a similar training plan. I had underestimated my MP, so I will focus on speed this next training block and might start making loftier goals\u2014 sub 3 one day? (Gasp!)  \n\nShout-out to the guy with the bib name \u201cNOTSURE\u201d (get the reference?)!\n\nMade with [Strava race report generator](https://race-report-gen.jezl.xyz/).",

In recent years, I\u2019ve attempted to mitigate my mid-life crisis by investing a lot of time and energy in running. Have run 8 half marathons over the course of the past 20 years. On February 8, 2025, I achieved my half marathon PR of 1:30:50. (That race report is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/s/43hAAUI7gU).) \n\nI ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). I registered to run this White Mountains Marathon in May and the Berlin Marathon in September 2025. My goal\u2014which felt extremely ambitious\u2014was to qualify for Boston in one of those next two races (3:15:00).\n\n### Training\n\nI followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan for this training block. After a full week off following the NYC Marathon, I ran approximately 40 miles per week through the rest of November and December. I officially started the Pfitz plan on 12/30/2024. The Mesa Half Marathon, where I achieved my PR, marked the end of Week 6 of that 18-week marathon training plan. \n\nTraining went well for the bulk of this block. I converted one lactate threshold workout to a general aerobic run after the half marathon but otherwise completed every workout and long run as scheduled in the plan. I trained based on a goal time of 3:10:00 to account for a Boston cutoff that I hope will be 5 minutes or less.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the rough pacing I used as a guide during this training block based on my perceived level of fitness and goal time:\n\n| Pacing Category | Heart Rate | Pace Range |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| Marathon Pace | 82-88% Max HR | 7:15/mi |\n| Lactate Threshold | 82-91%% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |\n| General Aerobic | 72-81% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |\n| Long Run | 75-84% Max HR | 7:59-8:42/mi |\n| Recovery | <76% Max HR | >9:26/mi |\n\nI did try to be aware of my heart rate but I was not a stickler about remaining in the recommended range, particularly for faster efforts and on long runs. If I\u2019m honest, I still struggled to slow down as much as I should have for some of the lighter efforts. My general aerobic runs were probably closer to the 7:55-8:20/mile range. On recovery runs I would sometimes get a few miles above 9:00/mile but seldom did I average over 9:10/mile for any of those runs. \n\nThe most challenging workout during this block was about five weeks out from race day: an 18 mile long run with 14 at marathon pace. I did hit the goal pace but that run took a lot out of me and left me questioning whether I could actually hold a 7:15/mile pace on race day. Aside from the Mesa Half Marathon early in the block, I did not do any tune up races during this cycle. Instead, I incorporated two 10K runs that I ran hard\u2014short of an all-out effort but faster than lactate threshold. Those were both great for building confidence and helping me to assess where my fitness was in the lead up to the race. I ran the first of those in 41:09 and the second one at 40:35. Both of those times represented new PRs for me at that distance.\n\nI did some hill work (uphill and downhill) throughout the course of the training block but not as much downhill as I thought I should have given the nature of this downhill course. There are a lot of rolling hills where I run so I think that even though I wasn\u2019t doing \u201chill-specific\u201d training, my legs were getting at least some of that conditioning in the course of my general training schedule.\n\nI tapered for approximately three weeks consistent with the dictates of the Pfitz plan. I was feeling pretty achy and sluggish in that final week before the race. Was definitely in my head but tried to put trust in my knowledge that I followed every step of the plan through the entire 18 weeks.\n\n### Training Conditions and Gear\n\nI live in Maine. Due to cold and icy conditions, I completed about 50% of my training runs on a treadmill. As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. Have had some slight but ongoing discomfort in my right hamstring and Achilles tendon but I managed to keep those discomforts from developing into anything more debilitating in this training block. I try to do basic strength training about twice a week. (After the Mesa Half Marathon, I noted that I wanted to develop that component of my training more but I have not really done this. I am hoping I can be more structured when I transition to my training for Berlin.)\n\nI train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions. Prior to finding this trainer, I experienced recurring and sometimes debilitating pain in each of my big toes. Because of the shoe adaptation and more careful monitoring of flareups, I made it through almost all of this training block with any significant disruptions in my training schedule due to health reasons. \n\nI did about a handful of my speed workouts in Hoka Cielo X1, which provides a plate to protect my toe along with responsiveness and bounce from the foam that helped generate some really snappy workout efforts during these months. \n\n### Pre-race\n\nArrived in New Hampshire on Saturday morning. Attended the race expo that afternoon. The expo was fairly standard. Not a lot of swag but good energy and efficient setup. I also picked up a pacing bracelet. I had spent a lot of time thinking about pacing and had a plan in mind. The bracelet was generally consistent with what I planned based on my pre-race research. \n\nWe stayed at the Hilton2Suites, which was one of several hotels affiliated with the race. (It was also dog friendly.) Cost was reasonable, the accommodations were comfortable, and the location was just minutes from where I needed to catch the shuttle to the starting line on race morning.\n\nI was fairly diligent with carb loading and hydration for the few days leading up to the race. I tend to have a sensitive stomach so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. Lots of bagels and pasta. I ate a plain pasta dinner at around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday. I was in bed by 7:30 p.m. although it took me a while to fall asleep. \n\nI woke up at 3:05 a.m. Had a few sips of coffee to get that essential plumbing moving. Success. Expecting a lot of rain, I applied more Body Glide than usual. Very glad I did! I caught the shuttle at around 3:40 a.m. It was about an hour ride from the shuttle pickup to the staging area at the start. I ate a bagel and finished my coffee during that ride. \n\nIt was a very wet morning but thankfully not too cold\u2014low 50s F. Arrived at the staging area, used the porta potty and then did my best to hunker down, thinking about my efforts to get to that moment while sipping sports drink for the next 45 minutes. \n\nI had a disposable poncho and layers of disposable clothing to stay warm and (mostly) dry. Was happy that I wore different shoes and socks on the shuttle. It was very nice to put on dry racing shoes (Alphafly 3) and socks to have relatively dry feet at the start of the race.\n\nThere was not a ton of space for warming up but because of the wet conditions small crowds (approximately 1200 racers), my pre-race routine was not bothered or derailed. After a short delay, the race started under steady rain at around 6:15 a.m.\n\n### Race\n\nMiles 1-5\n\nThe decline in these initial miles is significant (about 1400 feet). My plan was to go out at around 7:00 pace but given the substantial decline, I was flexible about going quicker based on my perceived effort. My paces were, in fact, quicker than planned but I truly felt that my effort was well within the range that I would expect for the start of a race. \n\nThe downhill was certainly noticeable\u2014significantly smoother (and easier) than the start of the NYC Marathon (or most of my long runs, frankly). I worked on maintaining a quick cadence with short strides to put as little pressure as possible on my quads as I navigated the downhill. That seemed to work for me. I didn\u2019t notice any more muscular fatigue in this downhill segment (or overall on this downhill course) than I do in any other race or long run effort. \n\nMiles 6-10\n\nWhile still feeling relatively fresh and composed, these next five miles for me were about settling in. Before the race, there was quite a bit of chatter about the uphill segment coming between miles 10-12. I was a bit in my head about that incline. \n\nI didn\u2019t know if I would use the pacing bracelet but I found it very helpful during this segment and then throughout the remainder of the race. Because the pacing band is calibrated to account for elevation changes, it was a useful tool to gauge my effort in the context of where I was \u201csupposed\u201d to be at each mile marker in the race. With the assistance of the bracelet I approached the uphill segment knowing that I was about one minute ahead of the prescribed pace for a 3:10:00 finish. That buffer gave me peace of mind and freedom to moderate my pace as needed to minimize exertion during the climb.\n\nMiles 10-12\n\nThe hill takes place in an up-and-back segment of an otherwise point-to-point course. It was challenging but when I got to it I felt prepared for it. Perhaps expecting something even more daunting,  I was able to lean into my experience running on rolling hills during the training cycle to navigate it fairly smoothly. It was approximately 200 feet of vertical and mostly gradual. I did allow my pace to drop significantly through this portion to prevent excessive fatigue but I did not feel at all derailed from my overall race plan and was still able to make it through this segment slightly quicker than contemplated on the pacing bracelet. \n\nThe turnaround for the descent was very motivating. It was still too early to start feeling like I was \u201cin the clear\u201d but having observed several runners knocked down by the hill, I was feeling relieved and confident that I still felt strong and relaxed.\n\nMiles 13-20\n\nThe field noticeably cleared after the half marathon marker. By the half marathon mark I was feeling mostly recovered from the uphill effort. My breathing was relaxed and I was settling back in around goal pace. \n\nThis chunk of the race was described as \u201crolling hills\u201d but it definitely felt more flat and downhill. There were a few short blips with slight climbs but, at least based on my experience, future racers should take heart that any perceived inclining segments in the latter half of the course are short lived.\n\nI do think it is worth flagging the substantial camber in the road throughout much of the course. It wasn\u2019t just in this segment but I think I was noticing it a bit more at this point in the race. I tried to be as strategic as possible, running at the center line of the road to minimize hip fatigue and using the camber to assist my effort to run some micro tangents and do my best to run no more than the straightest line through the course as the road weaved back and forth. \n\nI\u2019ll also note here that my decision to stay toward the peak of the camber as much as possible also helped me avoid puddles and runoff that were present on a recurring basis on this very rainy morning. \n\nMiles 20-26.2\n\nI felt very good when I hit mile 20. I continued to feel strong and was beginning to feel more confident that I would be able to hang on to reach my \u201cA\u201d goal. My stride still felt smooth and my breathing remained controlled. \n\nThen, almost out of nowhere, I felt the threat of stitch coming on at mile 23. I tried not to panic. I was about to have my 5th gel but decided to forego it. I opted to suck on a salt tab and got a good sip of water at the next mile marker. (I had a few salt tabs over the course of the race. I feel like they help mitigate the sweetness from the gels and also help keep my electrolytes in check.) I slowed slightly, focused on breathing, and pushed through it. \n\nBy mile 24.5 that discomfort mostly subsided and I forged ahead to the finish, with a final 10K under 44:00. I busted through the finish line with a sense of pride, accomplishment, and euphoria that, I suppose, are what this is all about. \n\nOh, and I got that BQ!\n\n### Post-Race and Overall Impressions \n\nThe course was spacious and comfortable throughout. The immersion in nature is fantastic but beware that there are almost no spectators in this race until mile 25+. I wondered what that would be like and whether I would want headphones to help carry me through it. I decided against headphones and I don\u2019t regret it. \n\nFor a Mainer who feels quite at home in the damp woods of New England, being able to hear the cascade of the river and streams throughout the course was very nourishing. I felt extremely focused and at peace throughout the entire run. I absolutely loved the crowds of the NYC Marathon but this race demonstrated that I can still conjure that race energy and adrenaline in the near silence of the White Mountains with nothing but the sounds of my breath, the cadence of my shoes hitting the pavement, and my own thoughts for 26.2 miles.\n\nI truly didn\u2019t know whether a BQ was in the cards for me. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. I feel so fortunate to have had this experience. \n\nI know that the Revel marathons are the source of all kinds of strong feelings for some runners. I tried not to engage with too much of that because I didn\u2019t want to absorb any negativity that could impact my goals or undermine the value I place on the work I put in to get here. Qualifying for Boston has been a driving force for me during these past 2.5 years as I have built towards this. After New York, I knew that the downhill course would increase my chances of achieving that goal. But I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy. And it wasn\u2019t easy! I  worked my ass off and I got the BQ. I did that with a lot of love and support from people around me and a lot of diligent commitment to myself. I am so emotional and so excited about that. But I also learned so much during this training block and in this race\u2014about running, about myself as a runner, and about myself as a person generally\u2014that is worth so much more than the numbers on the clock at the end of the race. \n\nWhether you seek a BQ, a PR, or you just want to tackle a different type of race where you truly have the opportunity to block out the noise in your life and do something special, I wholeheartedly recommend the White Mountains Marathon. \n\nI am very excited to continue on this journey! \n\nNext stop: Berlin! \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

During [the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1cqu75f/leidens_marathon_kicked_my_butt/) I was mostly questioning myself if would be able to do it. For [the second time](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1g8mss6/amsterdam_marathon_2024_very_crowded/) I felt bit more confident, but still kind of wondered if the previous one wasn't a fluke. For this one I was going all in. I did Pfitz 18/55 again, but added some changes based on my previous experience:\n\n1. Increased all the runs shorter than 10k to 10k. The short and easy runs were not going to cut it for me, so I set the bar at 10k.\n2. Added 10 strides on every easy run. That meant adding between 3k to 5k per week. This proved hard at the beginning. I didn't know how to run strides and each bout of speed felt unnatural and exhausting. Amazingly, by half of the plan it became natural, I was actually able to work on form and running fast didn't feel super hard anymore.\n3. Every long run became a progression run with at least 5k of marathon pace. This one came as direct feedback from my second marathon. There I really felt I was lacking practice sustaining marathon pace. I had had marathon pace runs in that training block, but still the race felt all the time like I was struggling. So after reading about it and kind of following the advice by Stephen Scullion (in some video I can't recall he talks about the importance of having marathon pace stints in your long runs) I decided to give it a go and man it paid.\n\nI managed to follow the plan to the letter, only having to juggle runs a couple of times to fit work schedule. Besides that I stayed consistent and managed to run all the runs, no skips.\n\nAfter all that I felt ready. VDOT calculator suggested I should be able to run a 3.13 based on a 10k race where I managed to do 42 mins, Garmin suggested 3.18 and Runalyze 3.23. All these projections felt scarily out of reach. I did my training cycle aiming at 3.30, that was already 18mins faster than my previous marathon, so aiming for 3.13 felt like fairy tales. However somehow during the taper my head started to believe I might be able to do it. I felt great during my longest runs (34km), I was able to sustain efforts 10s faster than marathon pace for 15k at the end of those long ones. I was even feeling good after those runs, not trashed.\n\nFor this time I decided to treat myself to a pair of race shoes. In the past I didn't feel \"fast enough\" to think that super shoes would matter. Now I was a bit more confident and at the same time eager to go all in. So I said to myself I would put it all on the table, if that means having racing shoes too, so be it. I got myself the Adios Pro 3. I read many comments and people seemed to agree they were forgiving with \"no so fast\" paces. I gave them 5 runs before the race: 26k, 20k, 10k (dress rehearsal run) and 6k (shake out run). I felt I was fucking flying in them.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThis time I did carbo load. The previous times I knowingly ignored it because I read somewhere it wasn't that effective so I figured I would try next time. This time I increased the carbs consumption for 3 days before the race. They usually recommend 2, but I wouldn't be able to do it in that time, so I went slower and longer.\n\n# Race (here's the f**** Garmin part)\n\nI was ready. The weather was nice, fresh but not cold, sunny but not scorching. I went to my start wave, got set and got my watch ready to start tracking, it blinked \"GPS acquired\". Some waiting then people started walking, then softly jogging, the start was on sight, I was about to start running, I pressed the start button and...no vibration. I looked at my watch and I panicked a bit. The blue triangle of dead was on screen. WTF Garmin, how can you do this right at this moment. I stopped 100m from the start, pressed some buttons in desperation trying to do something, but I knew it was pointless. I felt confused for a second, I felt like a \"strava runner\" whining in my head because my watch won't track my run. Then I told myself there was no point in complaining and the hard work was done already. So I just started running, trying to brainstorm at the same time ways to keep myself more or less on track with time. I decided to go mostly by feel, I knew it was not going to be optimal, but when you get lemons you need to learn to make lemonade. I had to focus on remembering how I felt on my hard runs, oddly enough my core was my main gauge. I knew that when I pushed at marathon pace I could feel my core working, not dying, but also not relaxed. Around 2km I asked somebody their pace, 5.15, too slow, keep pushing. Then I remembered the pacers, I needed to find the 3.30 pacers. I pushed pushed pushed. No pacers in sight. Since I stopped a bit before starting the pacers had overtaken me long ago. At this point I was trying to have some indication of my pace by using my phone's stopwatch and the race's KM markers. I would lap while crossing a KM marker and look at the elapsed time since the last one. I kept pushing and found the 3.45 pacers. There was still work to do but I was getting afraid I might burn out because I was going too fast trying to catch them. I kept pushing as I felt ok, then somewhere between 10km and 15km I managed to reach the 3.30 pacers. I tagged along with them for about 1 or 2 kms, but it felt very slow. My core was telling me I wasn't pushing as hard as I was expecting to feel and I was feeling very good, so I started pushing a bit more and left them behind. I kept telling myself that if I started to feel bad I can always slowdown a bit a latch onto them. I kept running, checking my pace with my phone every 2 or 3 kms, I tried doing it per km, but sometimes I forgot, others I got carried away eating a gel or trying to get water from the water station. So in the end feeling was my main driver. The last 10k were HARD. In my previous marathons the last 10 were hard too, but this time it felt much harder, I think mostly because of all the nonsense at the beginning trying to catch the pacers and not having a reliable way to pace myself. I had to focus on music to silence the pain, on the crowds and kept telling myself that I was enjoying this. At some point I remembered an Eliud Kipchoge's interview where he said something along the lines that he smiled when the race became hard to withstand the pain. I tried smiling on what I can only imagine looked like a mad man's smile. Between all those things I managed to push through and reached the finish line. Relief rushed, I knew I did a good job as soon as I saw the finish line showing less than 3.30. Got my medal, a bottle of water and a couple tears escaped my eyes.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI'm sore, with a bit of chafing below my armpits because I forgot to apply body glide there, but very happy and after all kind of grateful of the odd experience I got to live. I don't think I would have chosen to run without my watch, but in hindsight I think I enjoyed the run quite a lot more than I would have if I were stressing looking at the little screen.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.

In the months leading up to my decision, I had tried to run regularly, largely to lose some extra kilos I had packed after a summer of drinking all the delicious (but incredibly cheap) beer that Portugal had to offer. I hadn't been as consistent as I would have liked: I did around 230km total between August and Dec 2023, with my longest run/walk being 12.20km at 7:25/km pace. I had run a 10K event at the end of Oct 2023 at 5:57/km pace, which had been a pleasant surprise. I had previously, in 2017 and in 2019, also undergone spurts of wanting to get into running but these had meandered nowhere. My 5km pb from 2017 was 24:51, which I had run on a cold Toronto day, mostly downhill.\n\nI had two big motivations for wanting to run regularly now, in early 2024. First, regular physical recreation had always been an important part of my PhD, which was now approaching its end (aka dissertation writing was gathering steam). My preferred sport had been road cycling, but because my research involved a lot of extended travel after the first couple of years of grad school, the volume of my physical activity had dwindled substantially with each passing year. With all my data collection out of the way, and parts of the dissertation in decent shape, I felt a regular running schedule would help structure my writing and allow me to get into a good rhythm to finish the PhD. Second, in Oct 2023, my (soon to be) sister-in-law had gifted me a Garmin Forerunner 265, which was a considerable upgrade on the Garmin Forerunner 25 that I had picked up in 2017, as an incentive to start running. The 265 came with all the fancy Garmin plans that just blew my mind, so I experimented with a few, but could never be consistent until January 2024, when my better half and I returned to Coimbra, Portugal, where she was a doctoral student.\n\n### Training (the longer version)\n\nFrom Jan 2024 through to Mar 2024, training was stop-start and I only logged around 77km across the three months. But when a trip to Toronto loomed from April 2024 through to early July 2024, I committed to a Garmin training plan aimed at a 2-hour half marathon. Consistent training in April 2024 and May 2024 paid immediate dividends: on May 26, 2024, on a long training run, I ended up running my goal time (elapsed time on Strava was 2:06:xx, accounting for the different traffic lights etc. that are part and parcel of running in a city). But this effort left me exhausted, and when I tried a small recovery run two days later, my legs said no after the first 200 metres. So I took a week off running, and decided that I wanted to be able to run the same time but also have the fitness and strength to not struggle to walk up the stairs in the week after!\n\nAnd so, from April 2024 through to August 2024, I ended up logging around 640 km, which was by far my greatest volume of running. I was fairly regular, running 3-4x times a week, and did a mix of easy runs and intervals, whatever my watch suggested. In August 2024, on a long weekend run in Coimbra, I bettered my half-marathon time by recording a 1:57:57, and this time, I was able to go on my recovery run when the week started. In September 2024, I moved to G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, where I continued running regularly. I did a super easy 30km run on a beautiful Saturday in September and then, on Nov 1, 2024 I ran a 1:45:46 half-marathon on my own, enjoying the pace, and was able to do an easier 10km run the next day with my partner.\n\n### Training (the more immediate version)\n\nIn Jan 2025, I signed up for the G\u00f6ttingen Halbmarathon, scheduled for May 4, 2025. My goal was to break 1:40:00, and I was fairly confident that I could do so with the right amount of training. But this, dear reader, is where the upward and the always improving trajectory of my running adventures came to a grinding halt. In early Jan 2025, I was invited to interview for a tenure-track position in the US. This job process is super gruelling, and I spent much of my time in Jan and Feb preparing for the campus visit. I ran a fair bit in Jan 2025, logging around 72km of easy runs, but in February, I traveled to Portugal where the weather was not co-operating (it rained, a fair bit) and I decided to prioritize my professional life, thinking I'd return to training in March. I only logged 35km in all of Feb. Sadly, my prioritizing of the job opportunity did not pay dividends, and I spent much of March depressed and sad about what could have been. It continued to rain in Portugal, and with each day I dread the upcoming race for which I had signed up. \n\nAt the end of Mar 2025, my partner and I moved to Berlin (where we are for the next few months) and I decided that this was now or never. My lofty goal of 1:40:00 was nowhere in my mind: I just wanted to first, finish, and second, if possible, get a 1:50:00 and some race experience under my belt. I managed to log 125km in April, and focused mostly on time-training. I ran a couple of 1:15 runs at a tempo pace (running 13.9km and 14.3km), one run at around the one and a half hour mark (16.45km), and then a final long run at just under 1:40:00 (19.45km). I felt comfortable that I could finish, if all went well, and that I might even push my personal best, and squeeze in just under 1:45:46.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nBut, on Tuesday, April 29, with the race on Sunday, I went for my final hard effort run. I ran around 9km, at 4:30/km and suddenly, my mind starting doing mental math on the possibility of 1:40:00, which had been my original goal all along. The temptation was too much to ignore, and I decided to play it be feel on race day. I did a couple of super easy runs, one on Thursday, and one on Saturday, and we traveled to G\u00f6ttingen on Saturday to pick up my number and to check-in at the hotel for our stay.\n\nOther than just distances and times, I had been careful with my diet in April. After the first week of April, I stopped drinking alcohol to help with getting in good shape (even if this was a placebo thing on my part!). I had pasta for dinner the two nights before the race, and I snacked and hydrated a lot in the two days before Sunday. My body was fine: I had a blister on my 19.45km long run, which was a first, but I had drained it and it hadn't flared up since. I had experienced some chafing on my 16.45km run, which was also a first, but this hadn't reoccurred either. My only risky thing for the race was a new short that I picked up from Decathlon on Friday, just so I could have a zipped pocket for my gels!\n\nI got a good 8 hour sleep before the race, and my partner and I grabbed some porridge for breakfast from the train-station which was close to our hotel (and also the university housing in which we had lived when we were in G\u00f6ttingen). I spent an hour on the pot in the hotel, which I was very happy about, and then we waited for a local bus to take us to the event start, and I began to see other runners also arriving at the train and bus station where we were. The bus dropped us off around a 20-min walk from the event, and I joined the hundred or so runners walking the same way to the event. This area was all familiar to me, as I had spent my fall and winter running on these roads! My partner and reminisced about some of our runs together that had gone through this neighbourhood, which was quite lovely.\n\nWe arrived at the venue at 9:45am, and it was drizzling ever so slightly. The temperature was around 8 or 9 degrees, so I was bit worried that my shorts and my t-shirt might be insufficient. I used the restroom quickly, drank a gel (this had not been part of my original plan for the day, but I went with gut instinct) and did my stretches and, before you know it, it was time to line-up for the scheduled start at 10:00! I had decided, in the days prior, to line up in Block A, which the organizers had advised should be used by runners aiming for a sub 1:45. Even as I stood in Block A, my mind was still torn about playing it safe and running with the 1:45 time marker or with having confidence in myself and seeing what I could do on my own. The start was ever so slightly delayed: my partner told me after the event its because the organizers couldn't get the gun working and I joked that this was a very European problem (in the best way possible) since, if this was the US, half the crowd would have their guns ready to go in lieu of the start gun.\n\n### Race\n\nAnd just like that, there was an announcement for runners to be ready, and then there was a countdown! For one last time, I went over my race plan. My strategy was based on the out and back course that I was running. I knew that there was a slight uphill until the 2.5km mark, then a gradual downhill until the 8.5km, and then a short but noticeable climb would follow before a rolling terrain. All of this would take place mostly along the river, and then we'd enter the rolling fields towards the 12.5km mark (which was also the turnaround point). At around the 17km mark, we'd be back along the river, this time heading gradually uphill until the finish. My goal was to be near the halfway mark at the hour mark, and use that to calibrate my pace and target. \n\nBut when the gun went off, the excitement of the race, the energy of the crowd, and the effect of being in a fast corral meant the start was pacey. I spent the first hundred meters trying to stay within the 4:40-4:50/km pace, as many runners zoomed by from behind me. I tried to keep an ear out for the 1:45 pacer, just in case I needed to slow. But, as the first and then the second km wound down, and I was overtaken by a few more people who huffed and puffed, I settled into a nice rhythm. I had run the first two kms at 4:46 and 4:44, faster than my 4:50 ideal pace, and faster still than my 5:00 safe pace. Over the next 6km of overall gradual downhill, I held between 4:35 and 4:40, taking care to not go faster. After the 2.5km mark, I also begun reeling in some of the runners who had overtaken me in the first couple of kms-- this would become a theme as I slowly overtook a few runners, of all ages and sizes, who had started a bit too strongly and were now paying the price. The first hydrating station came at the 5km mark, and I eyeballed it to see how it was working and what they had. When the next hydrating station came at the 7km mark, I grabbed some water and fiddled with my shorts and zipper to take out my first gel.\n\nAs we left the river and turned inward, I overtook some more people, especially on the short climb, and made a mental note to slow down. But my body was not quite in the mood to listen to my brain, so I hovered around the 4:40/km mark. The wind was noticeable in the fields, and around the 10km mark is also where, if I remember correctly, the leaders were already heading back. As I approached the 12.5km turnaround point, I was aware that I was just slightly ahead of my 1:40:00 pace. When I turned around, I grabbed some water, and started counting down the minutes to 1:05, when I would have my second gel. I ended up eating a bit later, at the 1:10, because I felt I was fine. The main benefit of turning around on this course was being able to see the entire field of runners, and I crossed the 1:45, 2:00, 2:15, and the 2:30 pacers before I hit the river again. I was able to slow down, and ran around 4:45/km for around three km. \n\nWhen I was back out on the river, it was a slight uphill all the way to the end, and a couple of runners who had saved their strength and stamina, went zooming past me. I was tempted to follow, but I reminded myself that a short burst now could mean suffering later, so I focused on just increasing my pace ever so slightly, hovering around 4:30 mark. Some more runners came storming by and I, in turn, also ran past many people (some who were doing a 10k, others who here in the half with me). Knowing the course well came in handy in these last kilometres, and though I was able to maintain around 4:35 here, I could do so only because I knew exactly how far out I was. \n\nAs I rounded the road to enter the track where the finish line was, I tried to scope out the big clock next to the finish line. But I had some trouble seeing the time since some spectators were blocking my view. However, as I turned on the track and was around a 100m from the finish line, I saw the 1:39:xx on the clock and that was enough to know that I had made it! \n\n### Post-race\n\nI crossed the finish line, grabbed an apple and some water, and went outside the runner's area to meet, kiss, and hug my partner. I shared the race with her (as I would, over the rest of the day, and in the days since...), and she had already scoped out the entire stadium with respect to what I had to do next. She guided me to the showers, and then we walked back to the city centre since our bus back to Berlin was only leaving in the early evening. As the day wore on, I did feel the race in my body: I am not surprised, since I definitely went hard at a level that was just under my limit, and on a fairly insubstantial training volume. But the experience was good because now I officially have a baseline around which to train and on which to improve. As well, small things like packing a towel for the showers or having different clothing options ready are things I have now realized are pivotal to race prep.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about the G\u00f6ttingen Halbmarathon. If you're in the area or in Europe, its a wonderful race to participate in, especially if you want to make a small trip out of it. The starting field was around 1400 people, which was a great size, and the support was wonderful. I am very glad this this was my first half marathon experience!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

One of the distances that I had not set a new PR in during 2024 (because I set it in December 2023) was my half marathon.\n\nThe Frederick Half Marathon is in my hometown of Frederick, Maryland. Motto: Please don't move here, it's terrible (I love living here). I'd run the race itself 6 times prior to yesterday, and I regularly run almost every part of the course. While I am not a fan of the company that organizes the race, it's my hometown race, and I hadn't run it since 2019. It was my [first half marathon in 2012](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/t9wdy/nut_job_5k_first_half_marathon_race_report/) (and my first race report!), so I thought it would be fun to go back and conquer the old stomping grounds.\n\n### Training\n\nSince I pay for Strava premium, I thought why not try out one of their coaching plans? Before their recent acquisition of Runna, Strava had (and may still have, for all I know) training plans based on McMillan's training plans. I entered some data: a recent race time (my December 2024 marathon PR of 3:24:23), my goal time for the half (1:29:59), and the date of my goal race (5/4/2025). Then it spit out a 10 week training program for me. This worked out well, because a local 50k that I like to do every year would be the Saturday before the training plan started, so I could focus on the 50k, then switch right over to half marathon training a few days later.\n\nPrior to this, I had not followed an actual training plan since 2015, and I had never followed a training plan that included speed work. The plans I followed always just had mileage. Which, for the ultra-heavy schedule I usually run, is probably fine. But if I wanted to shave 7 minutes off of what was already a pretty decent half PR for a 48 year old (1:36:57), I was going to need to do the tough stuff.\n\nI work with a personal trainer at the gym on Mondays and Wednesdays, and the plan had me doing workout runs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with an easy run on Saturday, and a Sunday long run. Friday was a total rest day. I would sometimes add a short or medium run on Wednesday as well. I did all but 1 of the workouts, and pretty much nailed the rest. I used the Garmin app on my phone to build the workouts from the plan, and transferred the workouts to my watch, with all the intervals and a desired pace range built in. I think this was incredibly beneficial to my training. Sometimes it's more mental focus than physical ability that prevents me from holding a fast pace, and having my watch alert me if I got out of that pace range was a game-changer. Some might find that annoying, but it worked for me.\n\nI usually love to run all the races all the time, but during the 10 weeks of training, I only ran one race - a 10k on some very hilly terrain two weeks before my goal race. I ran that race at exactly the pace I needed to run the half, and felt like I still had something left at the end. This was a good sign. It was also nice to walk away from that 10k with 5th overall and 1st in my age group! So I thought I was ready.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nRight after Christmas, during which my family engorges ourselves for a 4 day bacchanal, I ran, without really trying, my 4th fastest half marathon ever, just as a training run on my own. I decided that I did so well because I had eaten so much fudge and cookies in the 4 days leading up to that run. To duplicate that Christmas indulgence, on May 1, I ate some leftover peanut butter fudge that I made for an aid station for the C&O 100 miler on April 26, then baked a batch of cookies on May 2, ate half the batch that day, and the other half on May 3. This was in addition to my regular, marginally more healthy, meals. Did I succeed in my goals in spite of, or because of, my carb loading strategy? Either way, I got to eat cookies and fudge.\n\nFor the record, I usually have a lot to drink at Christmas as well, and I abstained from alcohol entirely in the week leading up to this race. So I didn't follow along *exactly*.\n\nOn race morning, I had my usual breakfast, but added on a second cup of coffee and a donut. I arrived 1 hour early, as per usual, dropped off some stuff with the running club volunteers, went for a cursory 0.25 mile warm up, and got in the starting corral to talk with my friends and trade sandbagging lies. \"I'd be surprised if I can get under 1:30,\" said one friend, who went on to beat me by two minutes. I found out later that she's pregnant again.\n\nAnd then we were off.\n\n### Race\n\nI programmed the race into my watch as a workout - a single 13.1 mile interval with a goal pace between 6:37 and 6:50 per mile. 6:52 per mile is good enough to get under 1:30 for a half, but I wanted to build in a little wiggle room, in case the course ended up being long. I, of course, started off too fast (around 6:15), but with the watch pestering me, I quickly settled into my goal pace. I received no alerts about my pace after the first quarter mile. Once I dialed in, I was good.\n\nThe weather kind of sucked. It was a little chilly at the start, which would ordinarily be perfect, but it was very humid and spitting rain. I was soaked for most of the race, but didn't have any chafing problems. Over the years, I have learned how to avoid and manage most chafing issues before they become a serious problem. The temperature didn't really become a factor either. Maybe for a longer race, the humidity and warmth might have taken their toll, but this race was over quickly enough.\n\nI brought 3 Huma gels with me, and took them at miles 3, 7, and 10. I like Humas because I can eat them without needing to wash them down with any water. And this meant I wouldn't have to bring water with me. I've run a hundred miler with my handheld Nathan bottle, but at this quick pace, an extra pound on one arm and the sloshing water could have been really annoying. I did take water from every aid station and did my best to get the cups in the trash cans. I think I was about 50% on that. I was really proud of the fact that I didn't splash a single volunteer. The hand-offs were perfect. And that's a team effort. Thanks, volunteers!\n\nAround mile 8.5, I was thinking the pace was unsustainable, and that I wasn't going to be able to make my sub-1:30 goal. But just about at that moment, the 7 mile gel kicked in. It was the only one of the three that I actually felt, but I suspect that's because it was the only one that was caffeinated. I'm sure the other 2 had their benefits, but I actually felt that 7 mile gel.\n\nAt mile 10, I passed by the street that a friend of mine lives on. I had told her before the race that I would be passing by, and she could come out and cheer me. She asked what time, and I said 8:08. Damned if I didn't run right by her at 8:07:40. Probably my proudest accomplishment of the day.\n\nThe last 3 miles were just gutting it out. I kept looking at my watch, and saw the average pace tick down from 6:48 to 6:49. I did the math, and realized that gave me about 39 seconds of wiggle room, and I just needed to hold on going up the last hill. Once I was up the hill, it was just a little farther to the horse track. Yeah, the race ends on a horse track. No, it sucks to run on. Horses leave some pretty big holes in the ground as they go over it. Fortunately, because it was raining, the holes weren't that bad. But the track was soft and yielding. It was hard to build up a kick on that terrain. But I did, and finished in 1:29:03, slicing almost 8 minutes off a PR that I set less than a year and a half ago.\n\n### Post-race\nI had a mild case of exercise-induced asthma after I greeted my friends who were volunteering at the finish line, but that cleared up. That's a weird thing, and it's only the second time it's happened. I changed into dry clothes, rang the PR bell, and celebrated with my friends. A very nice surprise was that I got 3rd in my age group, which I have never done at a race this big! M45-49 is not an easy age group to place in.\n\n### The Takeaway\n\nThis was the first time I ran the Frederick Half since joining the Steeplechasers, the local running club, in 2019. In addition to the great benefits of being part of such a great running club, and having so many people to run with, it was really nice to be cheered on by different friends along the course. It felt like I had at least one or two people calling out my name every mile, and that really helped.\n\nI have been running since 2011, and I have been on a generally upward trajectory since then, although there have been ups, downs, and plateaus. But most of my improvement has come since joining the running club. I'm 48 years old and still setting PRs. There will come a time when I don't set any new PRs, but that time hasn't come yet!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Hoag OC Half Marathon\n* **Date:** May 4, 2025\n* **Distance:** 13.1\n* **Location:** Costa Mesa, CA \n* **Website:** https://ocmarathon.com/\n* **Time:** 2:06:55\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | 1:55 | *No* |\n| B | Sub 2 | *No* |\n| C | Finish the race | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 9:00\n| 2 | 8:29\n| 3 | 8:37\n| 4 | 8:58\n| 5 | 8:58\n| 6 | 9:06\n| 7 | 9:21\n| 8 | 10:36\n| 9 | 9:58\n| 10 | 10:14\n| 11 | 10:19\n| 12 | 10:14\n| 13 | 10:34\n| 14 | 8:31\n\n### Training\nFor this race, I followed a 19 week training plan through Runna. My plan included interval runs, tempo runs, hill repeats, long runs, and long runs with pace targets.  I ran 4 days a week which usually consisted of two hard runs, one easy run, and one long run.  I also did running-focused strength workouts 1-2 times per week. During the weeks I had hill repeats I usually had a long run with pace targets OR one speed workout to round out the two hard runs per week.  I peaked at 30 miles per week.  Overall I had a positive experience with the app, and enjoyed the structure and variety of workouts. My inputs to the app resulted in a plan that I now realize was too aggressive for my current level of fitness. I also think I should have spent 7 weeks on a general fitness/base building plan and then a 12 week half-marathon training block immediately after.  \n\nDuring the training block, my speed improved significantly, but my endurance and stamina did not improve as much as I would have wanted.  I suspect this is largely because I ran my easy runs too fast and neglected building my base in favor of beating or achieving the pace targets in my speed workouts.  I also suspect I should have only been doing one speed workout per week and fewer long runs with pace targets.  I thought attempting a more aggressive training plan would yield better results, but my performance in the last few weeks of the block and ultimately during the race showed me how much I needed to lay off the flashier workouts and focus on building my base. By the end of my training block I felt tired, not strong, but I figured that was normal and the taper would work its magic.  The taper DID work some magic, but I think I really was just tired--not overtrained, but maybe getting close.  \n\n### Race\nDuring the first half of the race I felt pretty good.  My plan was to keep it steady during the first 6-7 miles, and then try to speed up in the second half for a negative split. Miles 1-4 felt strong, but by mile 5 I started to slow down. By miles 6 and 7 I could feel myself fading.  From mile 8 onward I felt like the tank kept draining and no matter how much I tried to dig deep, I couldn't rally.  I used the PacePro feature on my Garmin and tried to follow the suggested splits as closely as possible, especially in the first few miles of the race which had some small rolling hills. Around miles 4-5 I was still 30 seconds ahead of my predicted finish time, but beginning around mile 6 I started falling behind.  At this point, I knew 1:55 wasn't going to happen, but maybe I could pull a sub-2 finish out of my assif I could rally in the latter half and make up some of the time.  Ultimately, I couldn't rally.  By mile 10 I decided I was just going to run at whatever pace felt comfortable and try to finish strong. I took in roughly 55g of carbs per hour (plus electrolytes) during the race, and had about 400-500 grams of carbs the day before with lots of water and electrolytes.  I don't think fueling was the problem, just my fitness and lack of aerobic base.\n\nThe crowds and the energy during the race were amazing, and some folks even ran with lightsabers in jedi robes in honor of May the 4th.  Even though my performance wasn't what I hoped for, I had an amazing time and it was a great first race. \n\n### Post-race\nShould I have gone into this race without a time goal since it was my first one?  Probably, yes.  But I wanted to push myself and try to do more than just finish, and I'm glad I set lofty goals even though I didn't achieve them.  This was a great first experience, and I'm very happy with how it went.  I proved to myself that I'm capable of more than I thought--it's just a matter of getting more (easy) miles under my belt and tweaking my approach to training to be more appropriate for where I'm currently at, NOT where I want to be.\n\nI'm going to take this next week off and just go for some walks outside before getting back to running. Depending on how I feel at the end of this week, I may take a few more days off from running and maybe hop on the bike before getting back to running. I plan to increase my mileage gradually before getting back into any structured plans.  I will likely use Runna again for my next race and for general training plans in between races, but I will adjust the difficulty and format so that I only have one speed/workout session per week and rarely have long runs with pace targets (and those that do have pace targets will be much easier pace targets than previously prescribed).  I plan to gradually increase my weekly mileage by running 5 days a week instead of 4, and most importantly: I'M GOING TO SLOW THE HELL DOWN ON MY EASY RUNS.  I'll keep up with strength training at least once per week.\n\nI'm looking forward to running my next half, but I think before I do that I want to work on speed over 5k and 10k distances.  So short term goals following this race: 1) rest and recover. 2) build up easy miles. 3) improve my 5k and 10k times (and maybe sign up for races at those distances)\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I signed up for this half marathon (part of the blue group 2:00-2:15 finish) at the end of December 2024, and at this point, my 5km time trial time was 29:59.\n\nFor my first ever training block, I decided to follow Runna as I had absolutely no clue what I was doing. I only started running 6 months ago, averaging one parkrun a week, and getting injured every other week. I decided to get a grip and drop the ego, going from weekly 5km time trials to planned runs which included many zone 2 easy runs, tempo and long runs. My weekly mileage ramped up to a 28 km average during the 16 week training block (peaking at 46 km), which I fortunately stuck to and came out of unscathed. For my 15km long run 2 weeks out, I ran the final 15km of the course (downloaded the app RunGo which guided me through the previous year's route) at an average pace of 6:52min/km (I bonked hard). Runna helped add great structure to my runs as I had no experience planning all that out myself. I also have a weak gut so training with gels and training to eat before runs was a must.\n\nPrior to starting the training block, I was also a gym girly, but from then I only did one full body session per week to be able to balance my computer science degree, work and life.\n\n# Race Strategy\n\nAfter spending hours and hours reading race reports and watching youtube videos about half marathons, I devised my strategy (based off my 1:57:49 Runna prediction) of going out \"slow\", a 5:50/km pace and ramp it up by 10 seconds every 7km (so 5:50/km then 5:40 then 5:30). I knew this was a bit ambitious as the elevation was concentrated in the last 5km and a 22 km training run I did a month and a half before averaged a 7:31/km pace where I bonked hard (I bonked quite a lot of my long runs by not eating/hydrating enough).\n\nI downloaded the Race Screen on my Garmin watch which is really cool as it predicts your finish time which updates based on current pace and corrects the distance between the GPS-measured distance and the actual race course distance. My strategy was to manually lap every 5km when passing the course flags, as suggested by other runners.\n\nI brought out my kitchen scale and tracked basically everything I ate for the 3 days leading to the race, ensuring I was effectively carb-loading and not eating too much fat/protein. I also ensured my hydration levels were superb and took electrolytes and magnesium supplements to help ward off the cramps.\n\nI didn't run with any music or my phone as I preferred to lock in in silence.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nThe day before the race, I went on an easy 5km run to shake out the legs and got some final words of wisdom from a friend to not go out too fast or I'll die. My very initial strategy of sticking to a 2hr pacer was thrown out the window as apparently they do even splits and I wanted to start off a bit slower. The rest of the day consisted of eating and resting at my friend\u2019s house as she very kindly offered her spare bedroom as her and her boyfriend were running the half as well! I had a good night's sleep (just over 7 hrs and a sleep score of 80 YAY), didn't eat breakfast before the race to play it safe with my sensitive gut. We set off to the start line at 5:50am so we had plenty of time to warm up before the 7:49am start.\n\n# Race\n\nFirst 7km block- I ran past the starting line at 7:48am with my friend and a dream. The first 7km had more hills than I expected, but I conquered them well by holding back on the incline. We were hovering just above 5:50min/km pace which I was ok with as at least we didn't go out too fast. It felt like a bit of a push as there was sun and I was starting to feel the heat, but it definitely felt like a pace I could hold on to for the rest of the run.\n\nSecond 7km block- The plan was to pick up the pace to 5:40/km for the next 7km, which felt a tiny bit rougher but still ok as it was dead flat. This was the part where we ran next to the water so it was nice to look at the scenery. Suddenly, my friend tells me her wig is annoying her and I turn around to see it flinging around in her hand. She tries shoving it in her shorts but ultimately it ends up in the bin. What a sight to see if you were running behind us.\n\nI knew the 7kms after this was hilly so I tried to bank some time while on the flat, running an average 5:35/km pace on this block. This felt pretty tough but I still had something left in me and a sub 2 was still on the books.\n\nThird 7km block- I turned to my friend to let her know this was where the runners' k-hole began, as we now had to speed up to a 5:30/km pace, and face the hilly parts of this run. Unfortunately she dropped off 2km in and I had to face the hills alone. I tried not to panic when I saw the first one as I still had energy left in me to make up time on the decline, I just didn't let myself start walking. The hills felt never ending and my legs were starting to give out. I felt my inner thighs starting to chafe which was unfortunate since I've done multiple long runs in my shorts and have never had this issue. I'm assuming I went too hard on the carb load. After running up the majority of the hills, it seemed a sub 2 hr was still possible if I sprinted the last 3km (Macquarie's chair loop). I realised quickly that it was not happening, my legs started to feel really heavy and a side stitch was developing. I had to ditch my dream and settle for my B goal of a sub 6:00/km pace. I was well within so I was content and made it my mission to still finish off as strong as I could. The crowds were extremely uplifting with many cheers and people screaming out my name that they could read from the bib. My stitch disappeared and I got somewhat of a second wind for the last km. I tried smiling to delude myself into making the pain go away and finally I made it to the finish line.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI began the crawl to the end of the finishing area where I could finally sense freedom. I picked up my medal, along with a can of water and an apple and made my way around so I could watch my friend finish. My right foot started to hurt, along with my knee and unfortunately we had to start the march to the train station, approximately 20 minutes away.\n\nMy Garmin watch tracked 21.44km, very similar to my friend\u2019s 21.42km on her AW S9.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nUltimately, I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve had a better result and had so much fun running the iconic Sydney half marathon. I wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing except for applying chafing cream on my inner thighs.\n\nNow a day after, my legs feel pretty much completely healed and I\u2019m ready to get running again. I\u2019ve signed up for 3 shorter races, all in August, and have my sights set on signing up for my first marathon next year in Gold Coast!\n\nMy one tip to end off this race report - do not wear the LSKD Accelerate 3\" Running Short UNLESS you want your cheeks to be out.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

I will do donkey kicks, banded abductions, bridges, etc.  this seems to cause the stitch to not show up in training, but on race days on flat courses I still find that I can feel the stitch there and I need to focus on maintaining good form in order to keep it from impeding my race.\n\nThus, has anyone found that they had the same issue and was able to fix it permanently?",

This is my second race ever (ran a 5k last September) and my first half marathon. I have been running since March 2024 and never had been a runner in my life prior to this time. I never liked running until a random warm spring day last year when I decided to go for a jog and stuck with it. I was slow but I enjoyed it regardless. I found it to be good for my mental health just as much as my physical health. My running was pretty casual and sporadic 1-2x a week until January 1st of this year when I began the Nike Run Club half marathon training plan. \n\nI stuck to the plan for the most part, save for a few weeks in February when I hurt my knee and took it easy. I ran usually 4x a week and did some light weight training 2x a week. Coming into race week, I felt very prepared and excited for what lied ahead. My husband ran with me and while he did not train as much, he has a background in XC from high school and a base level of fitness appropriate for a HM.\n\n### Pre-race\nWe headed down to Wells yesterday afternoon, stopping to pick up our bibs and swag (branded zip-up fleeces). I was feeling very anxious most of the day--not even because of the race but in general--but these feelings dissipated after we went on a walk by the ocean and got dinner. We sat around a fire at the inn we were staying at to close out the evening. I showered and we got to bed around 8:30 PM...but, we did not sleep well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable enough but the room was warm and the inn did not have their AC units in yet. The mattress and sheets made it so any little movement my husband made I felt and vice versa. The minifridge was loud to the point where we ended up unplugging it in the middle of the night. We were irritated and nervous. We got maybe 5.5 or 6 hours of sleep in total which is less than we normally get most nights.\n\nWe woke up at 4:40 AM and I managed to eat a half a blueberry bagel and drink most of an Alani Nu energy drink. I felt energetic despite the poor sleep. We arrived at Wells Elementary School, our assigned parking location, only for one of the gals directing traffic to say there were few or possibly no spots. We tried anyways and found a spot and walked maybe 15 minutes to the school buses that were set to take us to the starting line. Along the way, we noticed how many empty spots were at the other parking options. \n\nThe bus line was incredibly long, too. The crowd had a nervous, incredulous energy as we all wondered how the hell we were going to start the race on time. It was maybe 6:20 AM at this point and the race was set to begin at 7:00 AM and there were hundreds of people behind us.\n\nWe arrived at the starting point after 6:30 AM. The lines for gear drop and port-a-potties were long and many people were confused about what lines were for what purpose. You could barely hear the announcer. It was after 7 AM by the time we made it to the front of the port-a-potty line. It also had started downpouring unexpectedly. We finally dropped our gear and walked to the starting line around 7:15 AM.\n\n### Race\nAs you can tell, pre-race kind of sucked and I worried the whole experience would be like that. But the race itself went so well.\n\nIt was a scenic course--along the ocean and zig-zagging across the marsh several times. And the rain passed quickly, thank god. We ran in a cloudy haze for the first couple miles which dissipated into some sunshine. There was some sporadic crowd support throughout the course with more towards the finish line and lots of signs that made me smile. The natural beauty of the course was enough to keep me going.\n\nMy husband and I maintained pretty steady splits and did not take a walking break until mile 11, where we walked for about 2 minutes. I was very proud of that, as I imagined we would take more walk breaks. I drank some water and electrolytes from my vest flasks while my husband hit up the many water and Gatorade stops along the way. We each took in 3 gels, at miles 5, 8, and 11 respectively. Once we hit mile 12, we sped things up since we still had some energy in the tank and did our fastest mile split at 9:52. We crossed the finish line hand-in-hand, just like we wanted to :)\n\n### Post-race\nWe almost immediately got on the bus to head back to our car. There was a crash on the main road through town so the bus got rerouted and ended up dropping us off closer to the elementary school, which was nice. We snapped a few photos with our medals, stretched, and drove back to the inn where we took showers and finished packing. Before we even left the parking lot I put in an order at a Five Guys nearby. Lo and behold, there was an accident on the interstate that made a 15 minute drive into a nearly 40 minute one. Once we arrived, the burgers and fries hit the spot, at least. Now we are home, headachy and sore but not too worse for wear.\n\n### Reflection\nI am really happy with how the race went despite not-ideal circumstances pre-race and less than impressive logistics from race team. I was pleasantly surprised with how strong and relatively effortless I felt through the bulk of the race. This gives me a lot of hope for the future of my running practice, and reinforces why I enjoy doing this so much. ",

I am a 24F and I've been an avid runner for about a decade, not consistently more on and off. It started when I first did cross country in high school, I was a decent runner and I broke 20s for a 5k once on a course I was very familiar with. After high school, I stopped running consistently, would go on short runs (>4 miles) very rarely. I did get more into weight training, I've been going to the gym mostly consistently for almost 4 years now. In 2023 I did a half marathon I signed up for pretty last minute. I did a long run barefoot ( I now know that was not a smart choice ), got injured, and was only able to train for about 2-3 weeks but I had been running a little more consistently at that time so I think I did well with a time of around 1:45:00. I really enjoyed it and decided I wanted to do a marathon next. Since Big Sur was the local big marathon in my area, I chose that one.\n\n**Plan**\n\nAfter doing some research on what plan would be best for me, I settled on this one based on my goals:\n\n[https://marathonhandbook.com/4-hour-marathon-pace/](https://marathonhandbook.com/4-hour-marathon-pace/)\n\nI knew just finishing the race would be my most important goal because I really did want to focus on having fun rather than a time. However, I think given my background, I felt confident that I could do sub 4 and chose this plan. I made some minor adjustments, most notably, I had to cut it down to 16 weeks from 20 weeks. I would also do 2 days of strength (upper and lower) so I replaced one rest day to focus on strength training, and the other I would do on a recovery run day.\n\n**Training**\n\nI started training on the second week of January (Week of 1/06). My plan consisted of was split into base, hills, interval, tempo, peak, and taper. I knew that I would have to train on hills so I did do most of my long runs on hilly terrain throughout the whole training period where I would get in between 1000-2000 ft of elevation on runs longer than 10 miles. The base period was a little rocky, I had to get used to running consistently again, though I admit I did miss a run here or there or would cut it short because of time constraints. I had to get used to double days of strength training and running because those took a toll on me. I started off with doing strength in the morning and runs in the evening but switched when I realized it was affecting my runs more than I'd like. Running in the morning before the sun would be scary and cold, it was harder to convince myself to get up than when I go to the gym because of the dark and cold. I admit I didn't really get used to it, I learned to tolerate it tho, especially after getting gloves!\n\nAbout a month into my training, I started training with a high school track team I coach for. However, I would not do my workouts with them because we obviously have different goals, but long runs and recovery runs I would do with them. Training while coaching was great to take advantage of my time but reflecting on it now, it wasn't a very good idea. I mostly ran with the varsity distance boys because they would run milage similar to mine but they definitely go faster than the RPE that I was supposed to be hitting and I would go along with them. For example, I did a 13 mi long run at 7:40/mi pace just to keep up with them. Also, my race pace runs would start of race pace but would end closer to low 8 min pace so I did go a little hard at some points. I stopped doing long runs with them after that because I did want to focus on recovery during my long runs and that helped. Even when not going some runs with them, I did notice I was going a little more than I should have since my race pace goal was my go to pace for a lot of runs that weren't workout. Throughout this time, with working, training, going to the gym, and coaching, I was tired all of the time so be prepared for that part.\n\n**Injury**\n\nSo my training was going great, I was feeling good during my runs, tired outside of that but I was being consistent. So on my 10th week of training (week of 3/10), I went for my long run. I was feeling great that week, very energized that day. I ended up pushing myself quite a bit during my 16 mi long run, and ended up doing 2000+ ft of elevation at an average race pace. I did stop a few times to figure out music and take gels and pictures but nothing longer than a minute or two. I was feeling great after this run, nothing hurt in the moment. However, the following week, during my tempo workout, I felt a sharp stinging pain down my outer right shin. I had been feeling some discomfort the past few weeks but nothing that got in the way of my running until now. I couldn't even do 3 miles so I cut it short. I definitely think that long run was the last straw my leg had before telling me I need to relax. I was originally planning on only taking a week off because I these were the weeks leading up to my peak which i felt were crucial but I realized  that was not a wise option. I ended up taking 2 full weeks off and on the third week easing back into it with low milage. During my time off, I focused on RICE. I would ice once a day for 10-20 minutes on an elevated surface. I would do some cardio on the elliptical, but it was hard to keep up the volume it. I tried biking my long run in the area where I do my hilly runs but I almost fell and cut it short 3 miles in. I also focused more on strength training again. It felt nice to be resting given that my body was tired almost constantly before this but I was getting bummed out knowing I was missing out on my top milage weeks and long runs where I wanted to practice race day practices (gels, gear, hydration, nutrition). I had been training in Saucony Endrophin Speed 3 shoes but got a new pair of Saucony Kinvara 14 (shoes I've owned before) shoes as I felt the lower drop could help out with my shins as well as interchanging between two different shoes. I also got compression sleeves that helped out tremendously. Once I was ready to get back on the program, I was able to squeeze in one week before starting the taper. My official taper was 2 weeks including race week.\n\n**Pre Race**\n\nI attended the expo after work on Friday and it got me feeling so excited for the run. I bought some last minute gels and chatted with the pacer organization. Everyone was really excited for me when I told them this was my first one. Throughout the week I was really nervous about the weather. I live in the area so I know Big Sur is breathtaking on sunny days and I was really looking forward to that but the weather had other plans. Week of was cloudy and colder than usual which really bummed be out after the past week had been gorgeous. I did do a rain dance a few times hoping I encourage the clouds to make it pour on Saturday so the forecast would move up a day but it didn't work :,(. Regardless I was really excited. Day before, I did an easy 3 mi shakeout run in the morning. The track team I coach had championships that day so I ended up sprinting back and forth during the meet to cheer and give my athletes their splits and that was not a good idea but that race did help get me more excited for my own race. For breakfast I ate a chorizo burrito and sweet bread. Lunch I had 2 slices of Costco lasagna. Dinner I had a Dominos Chicken Alfredo Pasta Bread Bowl (highly recommend!!!). I also dank 2 electrolyte drinks and stayed hydrated with water throughout the day. I wanted to go to bed by 7, but didn't end up falling asleep until around 8:30pm.\n\nDay of, I woke up around 2:20 am, got dressed and ate a bagel with peanut  butter and half a banana. I wore Lululemon leggings and align top, calf compression sleeves, a race belt,  Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 shoes, a hat, a thin throw away long sleeve and a pair of sweats with a jacket. I also put on race glitter on my face and wrote my mantras on each forearm. On the bus ride down I did get a bit car sick, likely a mix of nerves and the turns without being able to look outside because of the dark. Once we got there it was sprinkling so they gave us emergency plastic blankets while we waited. I drank a Guayaki Yerba Mate at about 5:40 am (has 150 mg of caffeine). There were plenty of porta potties, I went twice. First time I only waited about 7 minutes, second time I did wait about 15 minutes and I was getting nervous because corral A start was getting announced (I was corral B).I took a liquid GU (no caff) right as they were announcing my corral.  I was barley able to go and get my bag checked in on time so I wasn't able to warm up whatsoever. I wanted to join the 3:50 group but I started way in the back of corral B so I didn't end up finding them at the start. Race started at 6:52.\n\n**Pre Race**\n\nMile 1 -2: The race started in a wooded area. One of my goals was also to get a negative split so I didn't want to go too fast at the start. Since I started towards the back of the corral, most people were going a more relaxed pace but a mile in I looked at my watch and I realized I was going a bit slower than I wanted to so I decided to pick it up just a bit. It was difficult weaving through people at this point, especially after they close the second lane. I did do a lot of zig zagging to get past people and I was a little shy hoping I didn't look like a noob that was going out too fast at the start.\n\nMiles 3-5: At some point here, I noticed my apple watch was acting weird. I was using the fitness app tracking to track my run and during the  run, my watch stopped the run and said I was doing function stregth training. The rain droplets must've messed with it and I tried fixing it but from past experience, you cant go back to a previously started activity if you start a new activity. I'd have to start a new one so instead I pulled out my phone and started strava on there. The watch distracted me for a while and bummed me out but I tried not focusing on that. We were still in the woods and it looked  gorgeous with the fog and drizzling. There were minor rolling hills but very gradual that my legs didn't really feel them. It was still decently packed and difficult to get past people.  I took my second GU gel at station 4.8(no caff), I tried to stay running but almost chocked on the gel and felt i couldn't breathe for a few seconds there.\n\nMiles 6- 10: You come out to an open area with hills and ocean view. The headwind was a bit stronger here because of the openness, I tried running behind people to take on the wind but the runners started separating a bit more now that there was more space and I ended up ditching that strategy because I didn't want to get too close to peoples person space for an extended period of time. The winds weren't too strong though and this was a flat area. I noticed Strava wasn't giving me any of my splits (I realized later I set my activity to cycling not running) so I was really just guessing my pace here. I tried calculating it at each mile marker and felt I was doing a good pace. I took my second GU gel at station 10.4 (25mg caffeine), this time I stopped to drink my water.\n\nMile 11-13: I would see the hill from a distance and it got me nervous and excited.I ditched my top layer right before the hill started to give me an extra mental boost and queued some of my favorite songs. The hills were long but the incline was gradual so they didn't tire me out.  My pace slowed down just a bit but I was feeling good. My thighs had been feeling heavy already for a little while but nothing too bad that was getting affected by the hills.  When I say long hills I mean it, there were at least 2 points when I thought the hills were over but oh no, its still going. I wasn't dying to get them over with I was just suprised how long they were, \n\nBut when you got to the top and saw Bixby Bridge, it looked beautiful and made me excited to keep going. You could hear the piano from the last hill too before you turn the corner. I let the downhills take me so I could relax my body while letting gravity do the work. I grabbed a lemon GU at station 12.2 but didnt take it yet.\n\nMile 14- 16: At station 14.7, I took my GU and then I stopped for a quick bathroom break. I had been needing to go for a while now but this was the first one that didn't have a line. My knees started aching a bit and my legs were feeling tired but overall, I felt good. There was people giving tequila shots at some point and I was so tempted to take one for the fun of it but it was too early in that I wasn't ready to take that risk.\n\nMile 17-19: These were my hardest miles mentally. While training, the max milage I had gotten to was 16 miles and my body felt better then than it did in this moment. My mantras were smudged cause of the rain and sweat but I kept looking to them to remind me to keep it up. I didn't feel horrible but these miles did feel longer than the rest for me. I felt a blister starting to form on my right foot arch, my sock kept falling down and one of my toenails was in pain. Someone complimented my glitter at this point and that got me happy. I was also happy knowing each step I took was a new personal record for how much I've ran.\n\nMiles 20-24: I took a lil selfie at the 20 mile marker. The mental boost when reaching the 20s is real, my mind felt great at this point and got my body to not focus so much on how heavy my legs felt. I did want to cry a little bit at this point because I was so happy but so tired ad so excited, just a mix of emotions going on. I wanted to pick up the pace because of this and I did but also listened to my body to not go to crazy yet. I took my last GU (caffeinated) at station 21.2. There were some rolling hills but nothing too bad. I was excited for the strawberries but wasn't used to eating solid food while running so I had to force myself to swallow the one bite I took.\n\nMiles 25-26: When I saw the the 25 mile marker, I decided to pick up the pace. I was feeling great and was excited with the increasing number of spectators cheering us on. There was one last hill and it was a bit tough but I was so excited that it also didn't feel horrible. I took of my headphone during the hill so I could see if I could hear my family at the finish line. Once I passed the 26 mile marker and I could see the finish line, I booked it and kicked at the end. During my training, I practiced a 0.2 mile kick at the end of my runs for this moment. The announcer even gave me a little shoutout for my \"burst of speed\" which made me really happy! There were multiple mats at the finish line so I didn't stop until I crossed the last one just in case.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nMy family met me at the finishers village and I did shed a few tears from happiness and exhaustion when they hugged me. They were also excited that they saw me finish so strong. I was honestly very surprised I didn't see more people kicking at the end because it was something I thought was typical from my racing days in high school but I also realized most people were very tired. I grabbed my complimentary beer and had breakfast with my family and friends that came out to visit me. I felt so fortunate being able to bring together so many of my loved ones to celebrate this moment with me.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThat night I used a massage gun on my legs and it really helped out with soreness. I was sore for the next two days but if you do strength training, it's milder than that type of soreness. My joints did hurt though and I'm not used to that. I felt fine while waking but the aching was there. I'm taking this full week of from any strenuous physical activity, I've been going on walks and doing some yoga to stay active.\n\nI absolutely loved this race and recommend it to anyone willing to put in the work. I was very nervous about the hills but I practiced on some steeper hilly terrain  and that prepared me so well that the hills were not bad at all so that is my recommendation!!! I ended up with a negative 8 minute split! Starting slow and picking it up until the end was a great strategy for conserving energy for those last few miles cause I needed it.  Can't wait for the next one!\n\n**TL;DR**:  \nRan my first marathon at Big Sur as a 24F who\u2019s been an on-and-off runner for about a decade. Used a modified 16 week sub-4 training plan with added strength training and coached high school track during training (which led to pushing too hard at times). Training included some focus on hills with most long runs being on hilly terrain. Got shin splints in week 10 after a tough long run, took about 3 weeks off, and resumed one week before taper. Pre-race weather was colder and cloudier than I\u2019d hoped, and my watch stopped working during the race but despite setbacks, I stayed excited and focused on having fun and finishing strong. The hills weren't as bad as I expected because they were gradual, and the views were still gorgeous in the rainy conditions. Late teens miles were the hardest, last 10k was tiring but very exciting! Overall great experience and hit A,B,C goal and a negative split!   Big Sur is beautiful and I very much recommend this!",

That run was genuinely fun, and the surge of accomplishment I felt afterward was exhilarating. My first 10K had been back in 2016, where I finished in 1:22:48, taking plenty of walk breaks. I\u2019d clearly come a long way\u2014but I also knew I still had a long way to go. A time of 1:03:23 wasn\u2019t particularly impressive and I didn\u2019t feel anywhere close to calling myself \u201cfit.\u201d Still, I was proud of the progress and deeply motivated to keep going. I set my sights on a new goal: a sub-60-minute 10K at the 2025 TCS 10K. That gave me a full year to shave off those 3 minutes and 23 seconds.\n\n# Training\n\nIn May 2024, just a month after that year\u2019s TCS 10K, I invested in a Garmin Forerunner 965. Within the first couple of months of using it, it became clear that my training approach was far from ideal\u2014my watch frequently flagged my training status as \"Strained.\" My regimen had no structure, no training blocks, and no real plan; I just pushed myself to the limit every time, thinking that to improve, I just needed to run more and run harder. I ran countless 5K time trials, convinced they were the best way to improve. Then, in August 2024, I hit a setback: a knee injury\u2014chondromalacia patella in my left knee\u2014forced me to stop running altogether. During that time, I immersed myself in running videos on YouTube and scrolled through endless Reddit threads. It was probably my way of experiencing running vicariously, haha. While I was not running, I felt less energetic in general through the day and noticed that my mood wasn't as good as it used to be when I was running consistently. I really wanted to get back into it, but I wanted to do it the right way this time.\n\nAfter nearly two months without running, I eased back into it. I discovered that many people highly recommended Garmin's \"Daily Suggested Workout (DSW)\" feature, so I decided to give it a try. I gradually increased my weekly mileage by following the DSWs. Most of them were easy \"base\" runs. Doing these made me realize what people mean when they say  things like \"80% of your training volume should be easy runs\". Eventually, I switched to heart rate-based suggestions instead of pace-based ones, which I found to be much more effective. On January 27th 2025, I set the 2025 TCS 10K as a goal race event in Garmin and began the training plan tailored for it.\n\nFrom then on, I exclusively did what my watch told me to. Religiously. Every day, without fail. If I felt like running but my watch told me to rest, I rested. If I felt like taking a rest day but my watch told me to run, I ran. If I felt like running easy but the DSW was a tempo workout, I did the tempo. If I felt like running intervals but the DSW was a 45 minute base run at 153 bpm, I did the bloody 45 minute base run at 153 bpm.\n\nThe roads near where I live are in terrible condition, and the nearest parks and lakes where people go for runs are about a 15 minute bike ride away, so I was forced to do most of my training on the lone treadmill in my housing society's gym. Garmin bored me to death with those monotonous base runs at 153 bpm, but I did each and every single one of them. I listened to podcasts (mainly Andrew Huberman, Peter Attia, The World of Running, and WTF is with Nikhil Kamath) and a whole lot of music.\n\nOver 3 months, I started to notice real, tangible progress. The cardiac drift that would push me outside the base run HR range no longer did so, and the speed at which I could my base runs while staying within the recommended HR range gradually improved from 8.0 kmph to 8.6 kmph. I also ran a 5K race in February (29:24) and a 5K time trial on the treadmill in March (29:19). Both these runs felt significantly easier than the all-out 5Ks I used to run in 2024, which clocked in around 31-32 minutes and left me completely drained. This time, I felt stronger and far less exhausted. I could actually *feel* the improvement in my cardiovascular health.\n\nAs the race date approached, my confidence kept growing. I started to believe that the sub-60 goal was well within reach. Heck, on some days I thought to myself, \"Should I set a harder goal? Maybe I can go sub-59? Or maybe sub-58?\". I had seen posts and vlogs where people mentioned huge leaps like going from a 68 min 10K to a 53 min 10K in 1 year and felt like I was setting the bar too low for myself. But another part of me said I should take it one step at a time and stick to the sub-60 minute goal for now. I didn't want to push too hard and injure myself again, so I decided to not change my goal.\n\nAs April began, I started checking the event website and Instagram page daily, waiting for the course details to be released. Once they were out, I kept an eye on GeeksOnFeet\u2014a site run by a couple of passionate, seasoned runners from Bangalore whose route previews and pacing strategies I had found incredibly helpful for the 2024 TCS 10K. Once their article dropped, I read it in detail. I made mental notes of key sections of the course and their suggested strategy. I considered creating a PacePro plan for race day on my watch and leaving my phone behind, but I knew that common advice is to not try anything new on race day. So instead, I saved a screenshot of the recommended paces for each kilometer on my phone, just in case I needed to refer to it mid-race.\n\nDuring taper week, I started sleeping earlier and waking up earlier to prepare myself to wake up at 4:30 am on race day without feeling way too sleep deprived. I made sure I was drinking at least 3 liters of water per day and upped my carb intake by eating more pasta and bread based foods. I also took one extra rest day so I rested on both Thursday and Friday before the race. On Saturday, I went for a shakeout run that my watch suggested, which had 15 second sprint intervals with 2 minute recoveries. I did this off the treadmill, running circles around my housing society\u2014partly because it's close to impossible to execute those 15 second sprints properly on a treadmill and partly because I wanted to get accustomed to the feeling of running on the road. I felt light on my feet, my knees were feeling good, and my energy levels were high. I felt mentally and physically prepared for the race and my excitement was going higher and higher by the minute. I couldn't wait to get to the start line the next day!\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI woke up at 4:30 am, rose from the bed without pressing snooze even once (probably the first time in my life I've done that!), did a stretches and holds to wake up the quads, hamstrings, glutes and calves, ate a granola bar, and drank almost a liter of water. At 5:15 am I booked an auto-rickshaw and arrived at the venue at around 5:50 am, 20 minutes before gate closing time. I ate two small bananas on my way to the venue.\n\nThe place was packed, there seemed to be a lot more participants this time around compared to last year. I did some on-the-spot jogging and some hamstring swipes to get myself warmed up and ready. I wondered if I should've done more, but then again I didn't want to do anything new on race day :P At 6:15 am I went to the holding area for corral C; the crowd had already started walking toward the starting line so I quickly joined in. I brought up the run activity screen on my watch and readied my finger on the start button, inching closer to the start line, surrounded by a sea of people inching closer with me. I could see the dense, slow crowd of people before the start line convert to a sparser, faster mass of runners past the start line and as I moved toward it I felt quite emotional\u2014several months of training had culminated in this moment. I did not feel nervous. I felt confident. I felt happy. I felt well.\n\n# Race\n\nThe first couple of kilometers of the race were a lot better than last year since I was in corral C which was much faster on average as compared to corral F from last year which had a bunch of participants walking and not jogging/running. I didn't have to weave through the crowd by zig-zagging like last year. In fact, a lot of people around me seemed to be running at exactly my pace.\n\nKilometers 1 and 2 flew by in a jiffy, much of it was downhill running and I was on fresh legs. I had to mindfully keep myself from running too fast. If someone had told me to run at the most \"enjoyable\" speed, I'd probably be running at 5:45 or so, but I forced myself to stay around 6:00. I knew that running fast on downhills this early in the race would be counterproductive and that \"banking time\" was never a good idea. I trusted this advice that I had heard from multiple sources, and kept myself running at a steady and comfortable pace. I saw a blind participant running at a solid pace, hand linked to his guide runner by a short tether. Just ahead, another guide runner paced them. Witnessing this was incredibly inspiring and profoundly moving. As I ran behind them and read the words \"BLIND RUNNER\" on the back of one's T-shirt and \"SUPPORT RUNNER\" on the back of the other, it made me emotional to a point where tears almost welled up in my eyes. I find it hard to explain now in words exactly what I felt in that moment. Pride, admiration, humility, awe, all mixed together. But also something much deeper, more elusive. I was reminded of the resilience of the human spirit and the quiet, simple but powerful ways people lift each other up.\n\nKilometers 3 and 4 were slightly harder than I was expecting. There were 2 U-turns and some uphill sections. Nothing too difficult, but I found myself always overshooting or being a bit under the target pace. I couldn't \"lock in\" to it. I erred on the side of being slower rather than faster, fearing that too much energy loss in this stage would make the dreaded uphill of kilometer 5\u2014the \"mid-race challenge\" as the GeeksOnFeet race preview put it\u2014even more challenging. I powered through these two kilometers slightly slower than my goal pace. I remember my watch telling me that my average pace was around 6:05. Not too bad, I thought to myself. Last year at the 4 kilometer mark I was perhaps doing a 6:24 average pace and feeling like crap, this year was almost 20 seconds quicker and I felt strong. I powered through until the start of kilometer 5.\n\nKilometer 5 was HARD. I remember looking at my watch, seeing that my current pace was around 6:40, thinking to myself \"aw crap, I need to speed up\", trying to speed up, panting more, feeling like I've corrected to a good pace, looking back down at my watch and still seeing like a 6:35 current pace. This sort of thing happened multiple times. It felt like I put in a lot more effort for just a minimal pace improvement. I decided to not overexert though, thinking I'll make up for the lost time in the upcoming downhill sections of the course.\n\nKilometers 6 and 7 I don't even remember running. I had my AirPods on since the beginning of the run but I hadn't been playing anything on them until kilometer 5 where I threw on a song or two to distract myself from the uphill. In kilometers 6 and 7 I relied HEAVILY on music to keep me going. My focus was constantly switching between the music, my breathing, my cadence and my watch. I don't remember what I saw along the route, I don't remember what I was thinking or feeling. I did grab a sip of water at some point during these kilometers. And I remember searching for a trash bag along the way to throw the bottle after I was done drinking. There weren't enough trash bags along the route.\n\nKilometer 8 is the downhill I was looking forward to. I threw on some up-tempo music and just floored it. I wanted to recoup the time I had lost on kilometer 5. I tried to focus on my cadence and my form as I ran, and smiled as the air felt fresh, crisp and cool as a ran slightly faster through it. I watched the average pace gradually come down from 6:08 to 6:03. At this point I knew a sub 60 minute finish was almost a certainty.\n\nKilometer 9 felt great again. There was a slight uphill but this did not bother me one bit since I knew this was the penultimate kilometer and there were plenty of sights to distract from the effort. I ran past Cubbon Park and the majestic Vidhana Soudha. That stretch, wide and grand, felt incredible. I felt energetic and pumped to crush my PB, and overtook several runners in this section of the race.\n\nKilometer 10 was the craziest part of the race. When I saw the \"800m to go\" board, I started increasing my pace. I surged, and then surged again. My face contorted in effort, like it involuntarily does when you give an all-out effort at the gym. It felt like I'm pushing for a max deadlift or pushing through failure on the last lat pulldown. I grunted involuntarily, and sometimes voluntarily as I felt it helped me push harder. I didn't care what I looked like or what I sounded like. I saw the average pace on my watch go back down to 6:00. I was bang on target now. Last year during the last kilometer I was having agonizing thoughts like \"OMG WHERE IS THE FINISH LINE ALREADY?!\" and \"I JUST WANT THIS TO END\" and \"WHY AM I DOING THIS?\" but this time around I had one singular thought on my mind: \"NOTHING CAN STOP ME.\" I overtook a bunch of runners. With 500m to go, I glanced at my watch a final time. My heart rate had climbed to 188. I held steady. At 200m to go I saw another runner overtake me, yell \"C'MON!\" and make a dash for the finish. I felt supercharged by this. With the finish line in sight, I made the dash too. I gave it *everything*. I sprinted as fast I could and before I knew it, I crossed the finish line. I pressed the stop button on my watch the moment I crossed it. I didn't even look at the time. I knew it was sub-60.\n\n# Post-race\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, I caught up with the runner who had yelled \u201cC\u2019MON\u201d and sprinted ahead. I told him how that final burst of energy helped *me* push through the last 200 meters. We exchanged a few words, shared a laugh, and then went our separate ways. It felt great to connect\u2014even briefly\u2014with a total stranger over something as simple as running.\n\nI collected my medal and did a short cool-down routine before heading home. Once I got back, though, I felt a dull headache coming on, accompanied by a sluggish, foggy feeling. It kinda felt like a hangover. I popped a paracetamol, drank some ORS and plenty of water, and slept it off. By the evening, I felt completely fine.\n\nThe event was quite well organized\u2014seamless registration, a well-curated expo, quick bib collection, clear course details shared well in advance, plenty of refueling points along the route (which I should\u2019ve used better), energizing drum bands at key spots, and a route that struck the perfect balance between challenging and fun. The only negatives were the lack of enough trash bins along the route, which made disposing of water bottles tricky, and the post-race breakfast box, which included mostly unhealthy packaged snacks. Overall, the TCS 10K 2025 was an *amazing* experience. I felt proud of the discipline I\u2019d shown over the past few months, grateful for the journey, and already excited to continue onto greater achievements. I have the Bengaluru Runners Jatre 5K coming up in June, the Bengaluru 10K Challenge in July and then the Wipro Bengaluru Half Marathon (which will be my first half marathon) in September. If all goes well, I\u2019ll be back at the start line for TCS 10K 2026\u2014this time in Corral B\u2014and ready to chase a brand new PB!\n\nI would like to thank u/Main-Perception-993 for their [TCS 10K 2023 race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/13okq4f/tcs_bengaluru_my_first_10k/), which inspired me to write this race report.\n\nMade with the [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "Here's the story. Before I tell it, I've moved on and don't judge the guy for his choices. I'm more curious about other runners thoughts on the matter.\n\nMy hometown race is this weekend and it's always a fun time for me, like one big party weekend. It's not a world major marathon or race that sells out early. I have planned on doing the half with a friend for fun at party pace. Last weekend I ran a marathon with a goal time. I generally have a solid mix of goal races and fun races throughout the year.\n\nI held off on registration for the half because the charity I wanted to run for was having technical issues with the race organization, and I also had plans that could have changed, so I waited to see.\n\nIn my run club, there was a man who got injured and posted that he wanted to give his bib away, and I offered to pay but he said I should just pay for the transfer. He also mentioned in the post that it might be too late to transfer, and I expressed that I didn't mind either way and we agreed. I was also up front about running for fun. He deleted the post, emailed the organization, and I went about my week assuming I had a bib. After several days of not hearing anything, I messaged him. No response for two days. Then, yesterday he tells me that the organization wouldn't let him transfer because he already switched events. He also said that he was just going to let the bib go to waste because he didn't want to mess up his running history with the time I would run and I needed to get another one.\n\nI did find another bib, was able to get it transferred to my name, and I respect that he can do what he wants with a wasted $200 race registration. This led to my friend and I debating how much one's \"run history\" matters from race to race. The first time I ran a half marathon 10+ years ago I did so because a friend of a friend sold me his bib cheap when he got injured. He was elite seeded. So I thought I would bring this to a larger group. What do you think?\n\nTLDR: Man agrees to give up a bib due to injury, then changes his mind a week later because he doesn't want his race times \"messed up\" by someone else using his bib. I was just curious to know how the run community as a whole felt about it.",

I did my first half marathon 3 years ago and have done 4 halfs in total now. I started doing long gentle runs beyond the half marathon distance at the end of 2023. I enjoyed these and found them a fun and relaxing weekend activity, which made me think I could try a marathon one day, hence signing up for Manchester the following year.\n\n### Training\nI followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan for this marathon. In spring 2024 I worked up to a base of around 60-70km per week, all mostly gentle steady runs. I was hoping to work on this more and increase mileage/add some speed workouts but sadly got ill with a never ending chest infection over summer and did zero to minimal running for over 3 months. Picked it back up around September 2024 to run a half marathon in October after which I built my base back up to 60-70ish km a week to get ready for the marathon training block. \n\nI personally loved the structure of Pfitz and enjoyed knowing exactly what to do on each run. I would say the ramp up was intense and in retrospect I could've prepped better with higher base mileage. I flirted with some overuse injuries (plantar fasciitis, shin and knee niggles) but got to the physio quickly when these cropped up and started a strength routine. This seemed to help, but most of my other hobbies fell to the wayside in between all of the running, strength and stretching to be honest.\n\nI did almost all of the mileage in the plan, barring half a week out with a cold, but not quite all of the intensity due to the aforementioned niggles. I didn\u2019t love the VO2 max work at the end, it made me a bit nervy and worried that I\u2019d get injured from pushing the faster speeds, whether from tripping or pulling a muscle. \n\nNevertheless I felt well prepared and the most running-fit that I have ever been. I got an unofficial, just on my watch rather than raced, 10k (46 mins) and 5k (22mins) pb during the plan as part of the workout runs. Marathon pace long runs all went well. I considered going for a more ambitious first marathon goal, maybe 3:52 or even 3:50 but very glad I didn't in the end. \n\n### Pre-race\nI started my carb load on the Thursday and tried to get in 8 grams carbs per kg body weight over 3 days. SIS carb drinks helped massively with this. \n\nI sadly fell and bashed my knee on the stairs at home on the Thursday. It swelled up, was not too painful to move but quite sore to touch. Panic ensued. The physio was not keen to say either way whether I should do the race, but confirmed it didn't seem too serious. As it didn't hurt too much while moving/walking (1-2 out of 10) the night before the race, I decided to run. Thankfully it is not any worse post-race.\n\nWent up to Manchester from London on the Saturday. Chomped on some bagels on the train, had pasta for lunch and pasta for dinner.\n\nPfitz had me down to run Thursday and do a shake-out on Saturday - I skipped both of these in favour of resting the bruised knee. \n\nAnxiety and nerves meant my resting heart rate was very high on the day pre-race and I felt wired so I decided to take some melatonin to sleep the night before the race. Fell asleep quickly but still woke up at 2am feeling nervous. Managed to fall asleep again at some point and woke up at 6:15.\n\nPre-race I had my usual porridge and a coffee. Kind friends that I was staying with dropped me and my partner off a few mins walk from the pre-race area at Old Trafford. Went straight to queue for a portaloo which took upwards of 40 minutes. \n\nThis is when I knew it was going to be a tough day as I started to feel very warm in the sun, even just from standing around in the queue for the loos. The cloud cover I'd hoped for was nowhere in sight. I really don\u2019t enjoy hot weather, even when I\u2019m not running a marathon! I told my partner then that I was going to sack off 3:55 and aim for just sub-4 instead, I think adjusting hopes/expectations early was a good call for me.  \n\n### Race\n\nI felt good easing into the run and not going out too fast with the adrenaline and excitement. Luckily where I was in the corral (grey wave) it didn't feel like other people were going out super fast either, which helped. I also hadn\u2019t run since the Wednesday and didn\u2019t even do a warm up so that might\u2019ve kept me slower at the start too. I didn't see a single pacer from where I was though so knew that I'd be pacing myself through it. \n\nI had a minor stitch from around 2k in until somewhere between 5 and 10k, this stressed me out because I worried it was there to stay for the whole run but I breathed through it and eventually it went away. Had my first gel around 5k, after the first water stop along with a salt stick chew. I should, in retrospect, maybe have had more to drink at the 5 and 10k water stops. I just had a few sips at those as the worry about the stitch was still in the back of my mind. At 10k I was already feeling very hot. \n\n10k to half marathon all felt okay, but not as amazing as I hoped to feel post-taper. My training runs with marathon pace were slightly quicker and also felt easier than race day despite being with fatigued legs, I think it was mainly from, again, just being so so hot, but I also wonder if I over or under-tapered? After 10k I started carrying the water with me and drinking the whole entire bottle between water stops. \n\nThe hill at Altrincham a bit before the halfway point was nothing too scary and I managed to keep good pace. The support around there was amazing and a massive boost.\n\nHalf marathon to around 30k is a bit of a blur, I feel like nothing of note happened in this bit, either good or bad - just tried to keep a steadyish pace, kept running and tried to not think too much about how hot I was feeling. \n\nI really should\u2019ve poured some water on myself to keep the body temp down but I tried once down my front but my suncream ran into my eyes and impacted my vision. I couldn\u2019t wet my back as my phone was in the back pocket of my vest and I was worried about it breaking - something I\u2019ll bear in mind and avoid for any hot races in the future.\n\n32k mark I still felt pretty good and was quite buoyed at the thought of just over 10k to go. But then I had my sixth (and what ended up being my final) gel around 34k which I really struggled to keep down. From that point onwards it was survival mode - the nausea, the heat, the extreme thirst all caught up with me. Seeing a discarded half-drunk lucozade on the floor and thinking that it looked quite tempting was a bit of a low point. A kind spectator giving out ice to runners was a high point. And so, I kept running. \n\nAt 38k things got particularly hard. I thought that telling myself 'just a park run to go' would be a comforting thought, but sadly (on this occasion) it was not! I was probably checking my watch far too often around here and the distance seemed to be ticking by excruciatingly slowly. I would feel like I must've run close to a km but when I checked my watch it had only been 300 metres or so. \n\nThe next 3 splits (38,39,40km) were considerably slower than all the rest at 6mins+ per km. I felt sub-4 slipping away from me and honestly was happy to give up on the goal and just focus on getting over the finish line. I knew I had a bit of buffer but as my watch was about 300-400m ahead of the course markers I wasn't sure how big the buffer was - my brain was not able to do the maths with everything else going on. I was wondering if this was The Wall: my legs felt like they couldn't move faster, my stomach was sloshing horribly from all the water, I was fighting extreme nausea, my body felt like it was on fire and all my mental energy was going towards not stopping. \n\nBUT, I had something of a mini second wind. Realising I had 2km or so to go felt much more bearable mentally and I suddenly felt like I could pick up the pace again, joy! Taller buildings providing some shade in the city centre also helped, some of the promised cloud cover also appeared and took the edge off the heat. I got back to goal pace (or close enough) for the last 2k, and finished in what felt like a sprint (in reality it was more like tempo run pace) down the finishing straight with about 40 seconds to spare.\n\n### Post-race\nFelt pretty emotional to finish, it was physically and mentally tough in that final stretch of 5k or so. I wanted to cry but was too dehydrated. And I sadly threw up quite soon after as all the water I'd consumed just didn't feel great in my stomach. My left calf cramped up not far from the finish line (after the water and protein bars but before the alcohol free beer). I\u2019d never experienced cramp before so that was a bit scary but sitting and stretching eased it.\n\nManaged to have some water, ribena and crisps in the city centre. Headed back to the friends I was staying with to have a glorious shower, then back into the city centre for a Mc Donalds and the slog back to London. Was extremely tired but the post-run endorphins were great and I was buzzing.\n\nI know this result is nothing crazy, but I'm so happy to have finished in one piece. I still have an appetite and enthusiasm to keep running, train more and to do another full marathon sometime in the not so distant future (i.e. maybe next year) - I consider that a win for my first foray into this distance! \n\nApols for the length and thanks for reading!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

I ran high school cross country and track, and since then have run somewhat consistently, mostly for mental health. I have a distance runner's build but haven't really attempted to properly train or race until now. Running a marathon has always been bucket list item for me. I started training for a marathon in 2019, which was cancelled due to the pandemic. Before training I was running a base of about 20-30mi/week and averaged 8:15 pace for long runs. I ran my first half marathon in November, finishing in 1:40:23 at 7:37 pace. The lesson from that race was to go out slower. I blew up at mile 10 and dropped to 8:15 pace through the finish. Did I learn my lesson? See the race section.\n\nMy wife and I are thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in June, and a challenge I anticipated during training was simultaneously training for the hike. Long distance running and thru-hiking do have some cross over, but we intended to do a few backpacking trips during the marathon training cycle that I would have to fit into my training plan. How'd that pan out? See the training section.\n\n# Training\n\nI started on a Pfitzinger 18/55 plan in the beginning of the year. I live in LA and a week into training the Eaton Fire turned the sky black and prevented me from running for a week. The third week I only ran a couple short runs because the air quality was still terrible. I was lucky enough to escape to SF for the weekend to visit friends and got a long run in around Golden Gate Park. The fourth week we were blessed with rain in LA, which cleared the air and allowed me to continue the training plan as scheduled. I ran my first 15 mile run in tears looking at the newly snow-covered San Gabriel mountains, thankful that my city was still here.\n\nThe fifth week I travelled to Mexico City for a wedding, where I woefully failed at upholding my training schedule despite packing every pair of running shorts I own. The company I worked for went out of business the day before I left, which, in combination with the Mexico City altitude, sent me into a sort of out of body experience for a couple days. It was a very physically demanding job with late nights that was bringing about a lot of stress, so I actually felt a huge amount of relief when it was over. I used this trip as an opportunity to start anew. I got one good run in at Chapultepec Park with a running buddy of mine. The altitude and smog in Mexico City is no joke, but the city shuts down the main thoroughfare to car traffic on Sundays to allow for a stunning run through the city center. My partner and I extended our Mexico trip for another week, where I once again planned to run and failed. Six weeks into an 18-week plan, I had already experienced several hiccups. I decided to switch over to the 12/55 plan going forward.\n\nOnce back home I was able to dedicate more time to training. My newly unemployed status allowed me to really focus on running like I never had before. It also allowed me to properly train for my upcoming thru-hike. Figuring out how to do weekend backpacking trips hiking 15mi/day and fitting in long runs, threshold runs, etc. wasn't easy. Ultimately I sacrificed some potential backpacking trips to my marathon training (to my wife's annoyance). I was worried about getting injured from backpacking and was probably too locked in to my training plan, so I only ended up backpacking a couple of weekends and cutting back my runs for those weeks but tried to maintain at least my long runs.\n\nI ran my longest run 5 weeks out from the race. 20 miles at 7:56 pace. I felt good the whole time. It was my first time really practicing with gels, which I hated, especially without water available to wash them down. It boosted my confidence to run at 3:30 marathon pace with relative ease. The following day I had shooting pain behind my right knee running up my hamstring that lasted throughout the week. It was enough to put me out for a week and a half. It wasn't until 3 weeks out that I really attempted to pick up training again.\n\nI had two solid weeks of training, including a 16-mile run that felt easy peasy at 7:42 pace. I felt like I had a 3:30 marathon in the bag. On the Friday a week and two days out from the race, for some idiotic reason, I decided to send it on a 5 mile run. That night, I felt a pain on the top of my left foot every time I put pressure on the ball of my foot. I hoped it was nothing, but the next morning it was more of the same. I talked to my OT friend, who was concerned I had a stress fracture and encouraged me to stay off of my feet until the race and possibly skip the race altogether if the pain continued. I was devastated. The thought of having made it to the week before the race, going through the fires, losing my job, and previous injury, all to get hurt a week out and miss the race? So I dutifully laid on the couch with my foot up for the last week. Each day I attempt to walk normally, and it continued to hurt. On the Friday two days before the race, I walked about 10 feet and felt no pain. I didn't dare attempt to walk any further for fear of risking making it worse. I was in a real conundrum. I desperately wanted to attempt to run the race, but I feared making the injury significantly worse and jeopardizing the thru-hike with my wife that has been years in the making.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI drove to Carmel that Friday with my wife and my dog, using a trekking pole as a cane as I picked up my race bib at the expo. I was thinking: who in their right mind is picking up a bib while using a cane and expects to run a marathon in two days? All I could think about was my foot. I planned to attempt a two mile shake out run on Saturday, and if I felt any pain I would call it. I rented an Airbnb near Santa Cruz with a few friends for the weekend. We were simultaneously celebrating a friend's birthday, so I was a bit worried about getting enough sleep for the race, but most of that worry was superseded by not knowing if I could even run the race. I started taking in more carbs on Thursday, with Friday being the biggest carb day, but it did feel a bit silly given that I still didn't know if I would run. Nevertheless, I stuffed myself with carbs. I made everyone pasta, I put down bagels, I drank my electrolyte drinks.\n\nSaturday morning. In a way this was like the race before the race. The two miles that would determine if I would race on Sunday. I strapped on my running shoes for the first time since I was injured and started running. I focused on running normally and not adjusting my stride to accommodate my foot. Half a mile with no pain. One mile with no pain. I was nearly in tears. I finished two miles and felt nothing. I busted in the door of the Airbnb and told my friends it was on. I was going to run the Big Sur Marathon.\n\nI had no expectations at this point of finishing the race. I had a slightly delusional mindset that I would forget about my foot and just run, and whenever my foot gave out I would stop. I had no intention of making my injury worse, but I was riding the high of making the decision to run. I laid out all of my clothes, my gear bag, set my alarm three times, and attempted to sleep before my 3AM wake up call. I maybe got 3 hours of bad sleep. At 3:05AM I was up and out the door with my wife and my dog. I forced down half a bagel with peanut butter and a banana. I arrived at the bus pick up at 3:50 and started heading toward Big Sur at 4:15.\n\nWe arrived at the start line at 5:30. It was 45F with a constant drizzle. By the time I got to the porta potties they were pretty much destroyed. I managed to squeeze myself under an awning to stay dry, but most people just endured the wet cold. 5 minutes before the start I forced down a honey stinger waffle and threw my gear check bag in the back of a truck. I lined up near the 4hr pacers, having no idea what pace I'd go. I had a well thought out pacing strategy that factored in the hills with a slightly negative split before the injury. But that went out the window with the injury. In the back of my mind, I still thought: what if my foot doesn't give out? What if I can still run a 3:30 marathon?\n\n# Race\n\nAt the start of the race the sun had just come up. The beginning of the course I was surrounded by fog rising from the redwoods. I felt no pain in my foot. I hit my first mile at 7:30 but I felt like I was trotting. Second mile: 7:06, still felt nothing. I knew I shouldn't be running a 7:06 at mile 2, but I couldn't help it. The first five miles I ran with nearly no effort under 7:30 pace. I found dirt on the side of the road to run on, thinking that could prolong the inevitable with my foot. I was already soaking wet from rain. For some reason I decided to bring sunglasses, which immediately went on top of my hat and didn't move.\n\nMile 6 I hit 8:15 pace, but I was manually lapping and I think it was .15 long. I took my first gel at this point. I had planned for a gel every 30 min. but the thought of choking one down that early made me change my mind. I caught up to the 3:30 pacers and decided to stick with them for a while. They were hitting closer to 3:25 pace, but it felt fine to me. I started to get annoyed with the constant pep talk and bigger group, so I decided to ditch them around mile 10 and go ahead. I began to think my foot was healed. I was in the clear and was hitting a 3:17 pace without much effort.\n\nMiles 10 & 11 are one long hill that reach the highest point of the course. I had trained for this and planned it in my pacing. So I just put my head down and focused on my breathing. Halfway through the hill, taiko drummers gave me a boost to keep going. I was surprised at how well I was handling the hill. First mile done at 8:29, second mile 8:03. My confidence=sky high...\n\nMile 12 was straight downhill leading to Bixby Bridge. I took my second gel at this point. My hands were so cold from the constant rain and chill that I used my teeth to get it open. Lots of people stopped at Bixby for photos. A grand piano playing Elton John. What the hell - here I was. I wanted to cry, but I also wanted to finish. I knew I had it in me to finish, so I bottled it up and kept on trucking.\n\nAfter the big downhill of mile 13 I started to feel pain in my left hamstring, then my right hamstring. I chose to ignore the pain. I wasn't going to let my hamstrings stop me from finishing this thing. By mile 16 my shoes and socks were soaked through and my heel started slipping out. I had to pull over to tighten my laces. Stopping did not feel good.\n\nAt mile 18 I began feeling a sharp pain in my right IT band running down my leg. My hamstrings were still singing, which I could ignore, but the IT band made my right leg feel like it was going to give out from under me. I prayed the pain would go away but it persisted. I attempted and failed to eat an energy chew from the course. I simply couldn't keep it down, and I spent like a full minute trying to get the package open. By mile 20 I could barely bend my right leg past about 30 degrees without immense pain. I remember thinking back to people tell me \"The real race begins at mile 20.\" Well, here we go.\n\nThe pain in my right leg was so bad I thought I couldn't finish. I made it this far, twenty miles into this damn race, and after all of this my IT band gives out? I was angry. But I just kept on hobbling. I focused on keeping my leg straight. If I bent it I thought it would go out from under me. What was so frustrating was that I had a ton of energy left in the tank. As I trotted along I was barely breathing. My heart rate was super low. If it wasn't for my leg I would be sending it home right now. Each mile felt like the longest mile of my life. I just didn't want to stop. I considered stopped to stretch but worried that if I stopped it would be all over. So I hobbled, and hobbled, and hobbled. At mile 23 I ate a fresh strawberry that tasted like the best thing I had ever eaten. Like nearly brought me to tears. I thought: thank god, not a gel, not a bagel. A f\\*cking strawberry.\n\nBy the time I made it to mile 25 and was still upright, I had the delusion I could still break 3:30. I had 15 minutes to go and would have to run back-to-back 7:30s after not bending my knee for 5 miles. So I attempted to send it, and immediately got put back in my hobbling place. I accepted my fate. Now all that was left was to cross the finish line. Around this point my GPS watch malfunctioned and added another 25 miles to my distance, which added a level of ridiculous comedy to the race as I looked down and saw I was now going at 4min/mile pace.\n\nAs soon as I saw the finish line I was in tears. I held everything back until this point, but now I had made it. Crossed the line, 3:36:10, my wife and my dog holding signs, ugly crying, grab a medal. I did it.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI could barely walk. My whole body was sore in a way I didn't know it could be. The insides of my elbows were sore. I tried to stretch but could barely get my limbs into stretching positions. Eventually I hobbled away from the finish line, got a Double-Double and animal style fries well done, and took a bath in a daze.\n\nBy the evening I attempted some more stretching. I crashed and slept for 10 hours. The next morning, I was still incredibly sore. Today I am still incredibly sore.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nI am so thankful I was even able to run this race given my injury. I am proud of myself for sticking with it and finishing. It went nothing like I had planned, but it delivered on being hard. Objectively, the Big Sur Marathon is incredible race. It's well-organized, challenging, and beautiful.\n\nBreaking 3:30 was so tantalizingly close, and I know I can do it when I am not injured. I think there is a path for me to BQ if I am smart about training and have the time.\n\nI can't run another marathon until after I hike the PCT, which couldn't be until March 2026 at the earliest. I certainly have the marathon itch now, if for nothing else but to break 3:30.\n\nFrom this experience I have learned the importance of going slow in training. Next time I will plan for more miles and slower miles. I also think some very simple strength training could have helped me prevent injury.\n\nThank you all for reading my race report. I look forward to leaning on this community when I train for a future marathon.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

I finished that race in 2:42:40 with a lot of foot pain and stopped running, had a severe hockey injury (tib fib) later that year and with the injury and subsequent pandemic was very sedentary for a couple years. After picking up other sports and getting active again I came back around to it and ran the Beat the Blerch 10k in 2023 (1:17), then the UW Cherry Blossom Half in 2024 (2:26), then decided to sign up for the 2024 Victoria Marathon and the 2025 Big Sur Marathon. I DNF'd the Victoria marathon at 22.5 miles as my leg was acting up, I had only run up to a half marathon in training for that marathon and hadn't followed a training plan.\n\n**Plan**\n\nI originally talked to family who had run marathons and picked out the Hal Higdon Marathon 3 training plan so that I could balance running + winter sports + the rest I needed. The plan called for 3 runs a week with some cross training, gradually increasing from a 6 mile long run to multiple 20 mile long runs. Once I was at 12 weeks from the marathon I also turned on the Strava marathon training plan for reminders.\n\n**Training**\n\nI neglected the training plan in December and January and when I picked it back up I fell behind in mileage as I was struggling to complete long runs. I kept loosely to the 3 run structure with easy run, medium/pacing run, long run. However my long run made up most of my distance and I ranged from 25-50km a week. I did one 15 (3/2), one 18 (3/23), and one 20 mile run (4/5) with 10-12 mile long runs in between the increased weeks. One of the shorter long runs in between (11mi 3/14) was a failed attempt at 16/17 miles. Most long runs included up to 1000ft of elevation--needed for big sur training in particular, but also an inevitable result of trying to fit in more than 10 miles of running around Seattle.\n\nAs I tapered from the 20 mile run I did a 13.1 mile run 4/12 and an 8 mile run 4/20. Week of the marathon I ran 5k Monday and jogged/walked 2.5 miles the day before the marathon after arriving in Monterey.\n\nHonestly obvious takeaways here are I should have stuck better to the training plan--if I had worked my way up through the early weeks, it wouldn't have been so hard to run and recover from the longer runs later in the process. That being said, getting up to 20 miles made a huge difference from the Victoria marathon attempt. With the 15, 18, and 20 mile runs I also fueled as I would for the marathon (eggs for breakfast, Xact nutrition bars and motts fruit snacks during run plus optional kit kat treats) and figured out what I would wear (Salomon adv skin 12 women's hydration vest, GC leggings, cherry blossom half shirt, brooks ghost max 2).\n\n**Pre-Race**\n\nI flew to California on Friday afternoon and drove to Seaside. Had a pasta lunch and sushi dinner. On Saturday morning I did a shakeout jog/walk (2.5 miles), picked up my bib and shirt at the race expo, and then made the unwise decision to explore the Monterey Bay aquarium. Afterward my friends picked up groceries for breakfast while I got my stuff ready and we had a pizza dinner around 6. Was in bed by 8:30 with an alarm set for 3:10am. Woke up several times worried about having my bus pickup ticket and bag ready.\n\nDay of, woke up at 3:10 and had 2 pre-boiled eggs and packed a bagel and cream cheese and another egg for the bus ride. Filled up water and walked to the bus stop with my friend--we also met another runner staying in the Airbnb next to ours. Got on the bus at 4am on the dot and absolutely zoned out for the 1hr15 bus ride in the dark, ate my bagel and egg as we got close. I knew it was going to be raining so I brought a rain jacket that I could either check or donate, but I noticed almost all the runners brought garbage bags and foil to sit on as we were waiting for an hour and a half in the rain to start after getting off the bus. Turns out that was the way to go. Split up from my friend as I was in B corral and he was in C (we definitely put the wrong times in our signups). I grabbed a tea and went through the port a potty lines, wandered around until I handed in my jacket and gear check bag at around 6:15 and started stretching. My rough plan for starting the race was to start at the very back of the corral, start off at a comfortable pace and let people pass me, and see whether I fell in better with the 5:30 or 5:50 pace groups.\n\n**Race**\n\nMile 1: lightly downhill through the woods, faster than expected, but getting thoroughly passed as the plan called for.\n\nMile 2/3: rolling hills through the woods, my friend from the C corral caught and passed me, feeling pretty good. First xact bar at mile 2 (just the one caffeinated one for the start).\n\nMile 4: breaking out of the woods and into the rain, getting back to a more sustainable pace but still feeling good. At this point I was no longer getting passed as much and had plenty of space to myself.\n\nMile 5-10: second xact bar at mile 5. the hills begin, I kind of forgot where hurricane hill was so I kept thinking it was right around the corner. Views insane. Around the 10k point I realized I am going too fast again (should not be hitting 1:15 10k). Third xact bar at mile 8.\n\nI met up with and was passed by the 5:30 pace group somewhere around mile 10-11.\n\nMile 11-12: fighting up hurricane hill. I did my best to measure my heart rate and walk whenever I went over 165, until I was back down below 150. Jogged/ran more than I expected to but still slowed down significantly. By mile 12 I was starting to feel miserable as I was soaked through and my clothes were sticking to me, tried rolling my sleeves up and down and fussing with it mostly made it worse. Ate fourth xact bar and a couple of fruit snacks on the hill.\n\nMile 12-14: was starting to lose it, also had forgotten where the pianist was meant to be so felt discouraged after there were no aid/entertainment stations on top of hurricane hill. But I started to hear piano around the corner! Reaching Bixby bridge I felt ecstatic and started to feel much better. Fifth bar at mile 14.\n\nMile 15-18: more great views but I did start to lose steam, took more brief walk breaks on hills to maintain heart rate. Some fruit snacks, plus sixth bar at mile 17.\n\nMile 19-20: struggling!! Started to get more spectators and started snacking more as I realized I had a lot left. Turned on my headphones, seventh bar at mile 20.\n\nMile 20-23: joined the 5:50 pace group and became one with the 5:50 hive mind. When the pacer walked I walked, when he jogged I jogged, matched his steps as much as I could. Eighth bar at mile 23.\n\nMile 23-24: powered by strawberry station, took back off, sang along a bit to my music when I was away from the pack. Let my heart rate get higher as I was pretty sure I was on track to finish comfortably, ran more walked less.\n\nMile 25-26: really powered through, walked a bit on the hills but tried to keep my momentum, snacked, took every single electrolyte drink offered. Aid stations were packing up at this point. Kept going!! Saw my friends at the finish line and finished strong and posed for the photos. I took the finisher cookies and my friends met me around the corner with hot chocolate and a croissant. Picked up a finisher jacket!\n\nThe hardest miles were probably coming down off of Hurricane Hill in the rain at mile 12 and hitting mile 19-20, but at both points I was able to recover and keep running. Before the race I did set up a Garmin pacepro strategy for 5:45 and the extra views for elevation and time remaining were useful but the splits were confusing, and I made the overly optimistic decision to set it to negative splits which made the splits much further off than they needed to be.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nAte cookies, croissant, hot chocolate, gatorade, cheeseburger, yam fries, and zucchini sticks in the subsequent hour or so. Had dessert for dinner. Wore my medal everywhere. Watched a lot of Ted Lasso. The next day I got in the ocean to \"ice\" my legs, walked around town a little bit, and then flew home.\n\nI'm really happy with this! If I try to run another marathon I will stick to my training better and start the race slower, but I honestly am just thrilled to have finished. I am signed up for a half marathon in the fall, I think that's my preferred distance and what I'm capable of really training for for now, but I'm proud to have pushed to the marathon distance this year. And actually enjoyed it! Big Sur was beautiful. The rain was mainly an upside coming from Seattle--I was worried about the heat and sun running in California.",

A Sub 1:30 Yes Splits\n\nMile Time 1 6:56 2 6:54 3 6:50 4 6:52 5 6:59 6 6:56 7 6:40 8 6:50 9 6:45 10 6:48 11 6:42 12 6:39 13.1 7:06\n\nFirst off sorry if this is too long this is my first race report.\n\nBackground info\n\nI started running in 2010 when I joined the cross country/track team my junior year of high school and had some decent times 18:30 5k, 4:57 mile for someone running only two years. After High School I ran off and on but never consistenly and never following any kind of plan. Around 2019 I started taking it seriously again only to lose all motivation when Covid started. Once summer 2020 came around I found the motivation again and have consistently trained since. The past five years I ended up running a little under 1000 miles, 1000 miles two years in a row, 1200 miles the next year and last year around 1750. I raced here and there a couple of 5 mile turkey trots and local 5ks. I like most people wanted to eventually run Boston. So I knew a first step was to first run under 1:30 for the half. I raced the DC half-marathon September 2024 and ran 1:33:24. I was happy but a little dissapointed. Now to the this races training cycle.\n\nTraining\n\nAfter the DC half I basically ran around 40mpw for the rest of 2024 except around the holidays and when I got my knee tattooed. Starting in February I did the Pfitz 12/47 half program. I followed the training to a tee only missing two workouts, the 38 minute tempo and the first 10k tune up race. I was sick during these weeks so I still ran all the volume in these weeks but all super easy miles. The training had me feeling pretty condfident I was hitting all the workouts and was quite suprised. Dont get me wrong the workouts were tough but I felt strong. The 10k tune up right before the race had me feeling a little deflated as I ran just over 40:00 minutes and was hoping for a little faster. I do not know the exact time becasue the race wasn't certified and my watch said I ran 6.1 miles in 39:25. I knew this was at the end of the training cycle so on fresh legs for the half I should be ok but still.\n\nPre-race\n\nNot much to say here. I was nervous because I knew I could probably meet my goal but also knew I would be pretty sad if I didn't meet it. A couple of friends were also signed up so we warmed up together talked about our goals and lined up in our corrals.\n\nRace\n\nThe plan was to go out with the 1:30 pacers for the first 6 miles and try to push for the remainder. The pacers said they were aiming for even splits so that was easy enough. After the first couple of miles I realized we were behind pace enough to start to worry me, but I felt good so I went with my plan to push on, knowing it could be a risk but also that I must. The first mile I did this I basically gained back the time I needed. From here on out on the hills I tried to stay arounf 6:50 which is still faster than the pace I needed but slower than the 6:40 I just ran. To my suprise I was feeling super strong so I was closer to high 6:40s. I took a gel at mile 7 mainly for the mental boost. I continued to push on and since the course was out and back I knew miles 8-10 were kind of uphill. So I was a little worried I would crash out later but I kept pushing. I kept feeling good so I was starting to get elated knowing that if I kept it up I would make my goal. Once I got to the flat land around mile 10/11 I had it in my head to really push the last 5k. This ended up being where I started to feel uncomfortable, particuarly around mile 12. I just kept pushing and crossed the finish line a little after 1:29!\n\nPost-race\n\nThe chip time ended up being 1:28:59 and my last 5k was almost 20:30 which felt really great after running 10 miles. After the race I watched my friends finish and am happy to report that they all hit their goals as well. Everyone ran a great race and it was an amazing feeling to share that with them all. The plan now is to build a base and start Pfitz 18/55 for the Philly marathon in November.",

I've been running for about 5 years now. My 5K PB going in is 18:30, 10K was 40:33, and full marathon 3:38:43. The 10k time wasn\u2019t exactly an all-in effort and set during a tempo run. The full marathon was run in some pretty tough conditions and paced a little too conservatively.\n\n\n\nThe goal for this year is to get me closer to that elusive sub 3-hour marathon time, and eventually get a shot at Boston. This half marathon was a check up of sorts to see how much progress I could make, explore what training works for me, and to run a race where I felt like I ran to my full potential.\n\n\n\n# Training\n\n\n\nI signed up on New Year's Day. I was reticent of getting ahead of myself, as I had just gotten back to consistent training in December and the back half of last year was marred by a litany of issues. After dealing with an overuse injury from my full marathon last April, I was largely sidelined for May and had to see a PT. Thankfully, this was a very good learning experience, and I found out I had fantastically weak hip flexors. It makes sense, I am seated for most of my day. After getting some exercises prescribed, I was right as rain and even PB\u2019d a 10K a couple months later. However, travel and illness would hound me from October right up to the start of December.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn terms of deciding a goal pace, I threw my 5K PB into the VDOT calculator. It spat out a pace of 4:01 / km ( 6:28 / mi.) A mixture of bemusement and shock took over. I knew what that pace felt like and thought \u201cain\u2019t no way.\u201d But I figured if the goal pace was too hard, I could always just dial it back in training. 4:10 / km (6:42 / mi) or even 4:15 / km (6:50 / mi) were still more than respectable paces.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor this training block, I decided that my 85 km / week just was not going to cut it for my goals. Not having the consistent mileage to backup my pace would likely see the floor being kicked out from under me about 15-ish km in or so. So, I went down the rabbit hole and tried to see what it\u2019d take to get there. What I arrived at was getting my consistent mileage up and adding in tempo segments to my long runs. I\u2019d go from 85 km (52 mi) to over 100 km (62 mi.) I would ramp this up to 125 km (77 mi) as a peak week over the course of 12 weeks. For the exact structure, you can find my set-up in this [comment right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jfgg51/official_qa_for_thursday_march_20_2025/misu3nu/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere was one semi-serious hiccup with training. I started to feel a bit tight in my left IT band about three weeks in. I immediately pulled back and took an impromptu de-load week. I made a mistake with my plan. I had scaled up the mileage, but not the strength work needed. So, I threw in an additional hip flexor routine (about 8 mins of work) 2-3 times a week, and that took care of it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAside from this, the other obstacle was the weather. I knew if I wanted to go the distance, I\u2019d need to get outside as much as I could. Race conditions would be relatively cold (5 - 10C / 41F - 50F,) and getting used to breathing in cold air would be a necessity. Only, this would be one of the snowiest winters in recent memory. Shoveling really took it out of me on some days, since it was a full body cardio and strength workout to clear the driveway. The snow eventually accumulated to some 2 metres (6 feet) in my yard. I\u2019m definitely investing in a snowblower next year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRunning through the snow was a nice change of pace, as it felt more like a trail run than anything, but it also meant I wasn\u2019t hitting my target paces easily until March. When I was stuck inside, my treadmill was limited to 8.4 mph / 13.52 kph or 7:09/mi / 4:26 /km. As a compromise I would hike the incline up to about 5-6% to compensate for those speed days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne key thing I had to learn how to do was to take my gels on at a faster running pace. My marathon pace was a positively leisurely 5:08 / km (8:16 / mi ) pace. Which was incredibly easy to take on gels at. So much so that I could basically shotgun a GU in seconds. At 4:01 / km (6:42 / mi) though, that\u2019d be more difficult. I figured out my strategy eventually. I\u2019d open the pack, sip some, swallow and then catch my breath. Repeating until I downed the whole thing. My gel of choice, Precision Fuel & Hydration not only had a lovely peach flavour, but I found it went down really easy even without water. Only thing\u2026 the caffeinated version doesn\u2019t taste like this,  and instead tastes like jet fuel.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn terms of key workouts, there was one I really wanted to nail about a month out from the race. A 3 x 5 km at race pace with 1 km floats in between. [You can see the detailed breakdown here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jh00zm/achievements_for_saturday_march_22_2025/mj60npl/), but in short, I smashed it, averaging 3:57 / km on those 5 km segments and against some awful wind at times. I felt pretty confident about being able to pull out 4:01 / km pace, assuming the winds weren\u2019t totally brutal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhich brings me into the wind. Holy smokes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so beaten up during a block. Towards the last few weeks of training and during the taper, 45 kph winds would be a consistent theme. Dealing with them was an exercise in frustration, even on a track, where it\u2019d be a tailwind half the time. I knew I couldn\u2019t take the easy way out and just run on the treadmill. What would happen if the race was windy?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Pre-race\nI decided on a 14 day taper for this race. The mileage reductions for week 1 would be about 85% of peak, and the following week would be down to 60% of peak. The key for this process was to maintain muscle tension. I had made this mistake for my full marathon by removing most if not all speedwork, and my legs definitely didn\u2019t feel poppy on race day. For this taper, I was religious about keeping strides in, even for the final week of the taper. In addition to that, my final session would feature 3 x 1600 m just a little past race pace to remind my legs how to run fast for a sustained period.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4 days out I decided to book a massage. This RMT was referred to me by my PT. As it so happened, he used to be a marathon runner as well, and qualified for Boston multiple times. I rarely have anyone to talk to about running, but to be able to speak to a veteran runner, that was an absolute treat. We discussed what I was going to be attempting and he decided that he wouldn't brutalize my legs too much. The main area of concern though was my lower back. That will definitely need fixing in the days and weeks to come.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2 days out from the race, I started to carbload. I had tried one using 10g of carb per kilo of bodyweight in training and I learned some really good lessons from that. First\u2026 don\u2019t take on carbs that have a lot of fat or protein. It takes a while for your gut to break them down and that\u2019s not going to be a good time when you have to pile on more in a few hours time. Second, get most of these early in the day. Bigger breakfast, big lunch, reasonable dinner. Third, that 10g per kg of body weight load did not feel great for me, so I went down to 8.5g / kilo instead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy shakeout run the day before had some very nasty 30 kph (18mph) winds with 60 kph (37mph) gusts. The race itself would be similar to this, but milder so I decided to do some last minute mental training. I accelerated past race pace against this wind. It was tough, but mentally it was important for me to do this. I needed to know what \u201ctoo hard\u201d felt like.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe night before, I never sleep well, that\u2019s what the sleep 2 nights out is for. I couldn\u2019t help but look at the weather. 19 kph (11 mph) with 40 kph (24 mph) gusts wasn\u2019t bad, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel like this would be a tough race. And boy, was it.\n\n\n\n# Race\n\n\n\nI woke up at 4:00 AM and had my usual breakfast, 2 PB&J bagels and about 380 mL of black coffee. No GI issues, so I was feeling good about running. I arrived about 40 minutes before start time. My warm up was an uneventful 2.9 km in the parking lot, with some 100 m strides sprinkled in to get the nervous energy out, and to prime my legs for what was to come. With about 15 minutes to go, I downed a non-caffeinated gel and made my way to my corral. Unlike last year, this time I was in the right place and not too far back. I had packed a space blanket in case it\u2019d be cold, but with the sun out and so many people around, it wasn\u2019t a concern at all. I guess I have a piece of a Chuck McGill cosplay now? The tongue of my right shoe was bothering me so I adjusted it. Remember this for later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy strategy going in was pretty simple. Do the pace and stick to it. Don\u2019t try to bank time. Don\u2019t sprint down any hills, coast, keep your strides reasonable, and save that energy for the uphills. Also, keep an eye on the pace. I know I have a bad habit of accidentally accelerating when excited or annoyed (looking at you lane 1 walkers at my local track.) There were 4 main hills in the back half of the race that I planned around. I had taken to giving them nicknames to make them easy to remember.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConditions for the day were Sunny, 5C (41f) slowly rising to about 12C (53f,) winds coming in from the northwest at 17 kph (10.5mph,) humidity at 60 %.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy kit for the day was relatively standard: hat, sunglasses, sweatband, Shokz, singlet, arm sleeves, fleece gloves, 5\u201d shorts, heart rate band, and Nike Vaporfly 3s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA couple of special additions made its way into my kit. The first, a small Canadian flag temporary tattoo on my left arm. The one closest to the heart. I won\u2019t get too much into the reasons why this was applied, but to keep it short, I\u2019ve been feeling a bit more patriotic as of late. The second, my socks. I had initially decided on no-show socks, but after reading about what happened in Vancouver, I decided to go for crew length blue and green, Vancouver\u2019s colours.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# 0 \u2013 3 km \u201cGo For Broke\u201d\nAt 07:30 sharp, we were off. Going off my experience last year, I was determined to not get caught in the crowd. It was difficult once again, since it was a mixed start with marathoners and half marathoners mingled. This wasn\u2019t the worst, since it kept me going out too fast for too long. I had Jack Daniels\u2019 words burning in my mind, and I wasn\u2019t keen on missing out on my goals due to some nerves in the first mile. The adrenaline was incredible, knowing that this was what the past 12 weeks was for was really something else.\n\nThe first three kilometres was a loop around Mississauga\u2019s downtown. We\u2019d be somewhat shielded from the windy conditions, but there were still sections where we got battered. I would just need to keep pace and from there on, Burnhamthrope road would be much more open and I could run my own race.\n\n\n\n# 3 \u2013 7 km Run ~~With~~ Against the Wind\nOnce I turned out onto Burnhamthrope Road, I knew this was going to be the actual start of the race. The wind was coming from the northwest as I was running southwest, so it was a bit of a headwind, but this section would be entirely downhill offsetting that disadvantage. Still, it was tough going. Being as short as I am, I started using some groups that were going about the same pace as me to block some of the wind. At times I found I needed to slow down. I was going well above my target pace and clawing at what would be a 10K race pace. Right after the 4 km mark I would pop my second and last gel. This time with 100mg of caffeine. This packet would save me so much more grief than I could ever describe. The little perk up kept me laser focused and the carbs would play a key role in the later stages.\n\n\n\n# 7 \u2013 11 km Art Class is in Session\nThe downhill section of the course was effectively over. Elevation changes would be the order of the day as we proceeded through the University of Toronto\u2019s Mississauga campus. We got a mild series of mild inclines and declines, a tease of what was to come. I saw an aid station coming up just after the 9k mark and decided that this would be my only stop. I grabbed a cup, sipped some, and promptly spilled some on myself, streaking my bib with the lovely red fruit punch flavour sponsored electrolyte beverage. What a happy accident.\n\n\n\n# 11 km \u2013 14km That Hill Ain\u2019t Right\nFrom here on, the hills continued into the forested suburbs of Mississauga road. Just before the 12 km marker, the first hill hit me. It was earlier than I anticipated, at least according to the course elevation chart. To keep things fun, I gave these hills names in training. The first one I called Bobby. Bobby hill was meant to be a 2.7% grade for 700m. NOPE. Turns out he was 4.6% grade for about 600m. Dismayed, I willed my legs to keep going.\n\n13 km was the turn-around for this race. The Mississauga half is a \u201cthere and back again\u201d type of course. I\u2019m used to doing hairpin turns in my neighbourhood, so that wasn\u2019t too bad. But this is when the race got absolutely hellish. We were now facing northwest, running directly against wind gusts of 40 kph (24 mph) and with more hills to come.\n\nThe second hill was Peggy at 14 km. Peggy hill was meant to be 2.6% for 1.270 km. Well, kind of, but not really. She averaged out to be 1.5% over 2.5 km. Less grade, but more distance. It was here I had my slowest split. 4:15 / km. Going uphill that long really tested me like I\u2019ve never been tested before. Especially in the wind I had to hang in there and just know that I would have one more \u201cbig\u201d one then a much more mild grade coming up. Only, there\u2019d be another spanner in the works.\n\n\n# 14 km \u2013 Murphy\u2019s Law\n\n\nJust after passing the 14 km mark, Murphy\u2019s law kicked in. My right shoe lace had come undone. I swore viciously, this had never happened during a race or time trial before. If anyone around me during that is reading this, I\u2019m so sorry you had to hear that. I had no choice but to pull over and re-tie it. My mind flashed back to the corral. Like an anime moment it became immediately clear what happened. It wasn't just the tongue. It was the knot being slightly too tight. My flow was broken up, and for the first time feel my muscle fatigue. I went down to a knee faster than I thought I would and skinned my pinky and ring finger knuckles a bit, drawing some blood on the sidewalk. With that mishap taken care of, and some more red on my singlet, I soldiered on.\n\n\n\n# 15km \u2013 21.0975 km \u2013 The Gloves Are Off\n\nIt was here I had to make a decision. I had taken my gloves off to tie my shoes and stowed them in my pocket for later use, but if I wanted to make it, I couldn\u2019t have extra fabric on me. The areas near my pockets were warming up. So, at the 15 km mark aid station, I threw out my gloves. I would\u2019ve liked to avoid this, but I was really in the trenches at this point. In hindsight, I really didn\u2019t need them in the first place. The sun made things plenty warm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI can\u2019t remember if it was here or earlier, but I was breathing pretty hard by now. In an effort to catch back up, the hills of 15-16km really were getting the better of me. The better of everyone really. Especially since we were running straight into the head winds now. A fellow runner noticed how hard I was breathing and shouted out some encouragement. I returned the favour best I could. We were all in this hilly, windy hell called the Electrolit Half Marathon, and we were going to finish it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust after the 17 km marker was the steepest hill of the lot. Cotton. A short distance to be sure, but Cotton hill would be pretty nasty. According to the elevation chart, it was 12.67% for 100 m. Nope. Turns out it was about 6.7% for 400m. To be honest, I'm not sure which would've been worse. But I didn\u2019t have time to think about it, because the final hill was up. Hank hill. Right after Cotton. An absolutely mild 1.8% for 1.4 km. This one was more or less accurate to the elevation chart, so I was relieved that some of the intel was correct. By now I was heading northeast. The wind I was running against was now more of a crosswind. Not exactly having the wind at my back, but given the circumstances, I welcomed it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter passing the 18 km marker, this is where things started to really hurt. A side stitch started to wreak havoc on me. My tired legs were still good, likely on account of the adequate carb intake, but the stitch was demanding attention. I haven\u2019t had a side stitch in years. Whether it was being thrown off my rhythm by the shoelace, or me pushing so hard to get back on pace against hills and wind, it didn\u2019t matter. I had to fix this and fast. I could feel my pace slowing. I desperately tried to get control of my breath again, but to no avail. Reluctantly, I shut my mouth and started inhaling through my nose, and out through my mouth. I knew this would fix it, but at the cost of some pace. The stitch wasn\u2019t gone entirely, but it was enough to get me through. I got myself back up to pace. I knew I just had to hold on a little longer. I was back in the shade of Mississauga\u2019s condo towers now, and felt immensely better.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI passed the 19km marker and felt the terrain even out. Sweet relief. I rounded the final corner and saw the 21 km marker. This was it. I glanced at the clock and it read 1:25. I knew that my chip time must be in the 1:24 range, so I put everything I had left into the final kick, hitting my 5K PB pace. Little did I know, that was the difference maker.\n\n\n\n# Post-race\n\n\n\nUpon finishing, I exchanged pleasantries with a few fellow runners. We were pace buddies at one point or another out there. We all congratulated one another, but more importantly we cursed the wind and the hills for pushing us to our limits.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I got back to the car that I managed to pull up the chip time results and the actual elevation data. 1:24:56 was the final time. Given the wind, the hills, and the shoelace thing, I\u2019m absolutely delighted with this time. I have no regrets about the race that I ran, I left everything out there on the roads, and that's all I really wanted for today.\n\nI had my fair share of doubts going into this race. I knew the VDOT calculator was relatively accurate, but only if the training was dialed in correctly. I would worry throughout training I wasn\u2019t doing enough speed work, or that my taper was too light, but I kept reminding myself \u201cdo you really think you know better than the dude who ran a 2:16 marathon, or the gal who did 2:25?\u201d Trusting the process was something I had to learn to do and it\u2019s paid off here. Now the question looming large in my mind is\u2026 can I extend this speed out and hit sub 3?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

After absolutely no running in grad school and during COVID, I picked up running again about a year and a half ago. I ran the SF City Half Marathon this past summer with the goal of just finishing but really struggled - I could tell my legs were dead after the first 4.5 miles (all uphill) and blew up the last three miles. I decided for my next training cycle for the Big Sur 11 miler to add in more mileage and more strength training.\n\nMy plan (based on Hal Higdon's Intermediate 2 program) featured 4 days of running, one day of cross training, 2 days of strength training heavily focused on lower body and core, and 1 rest day per week. My 4 running days were split into a speed work day, a tempo run, an easy run, and my long run. My plan was 16 weeks, mileage peaked at 35 MPW, longest run was 10 miles, and had a two week taper.\n\nOverall, I stuck to my training plan pretty religiously. In the past, I was never one to deviate my paces in my training runs (all runs at medium-to-hard effort) and I went all in on Zone 2 training for my easy run and cross training (about 12-14 minute miles) and made my hard efforts, well, hard. I ran into trouble twice: once relatively early on related to health challenges and once when I finally broke 30MPW (even though I follow the 10% rule for weekly mileage add). As a runner with some chronic health problems, I expect them to flare up at some point and they flared hard around weeks 4-6. I made changes to my diet to increase overall calorie and carb intake, increased hydration SIGNIFICANTLY, and added electrolytes to my runs and was able to adjust. When I hit 30 MPW, I just started really feeling it in my body and had some runs where I just felt like I had no legs. As a result, I missed one long run (planned 9 miler) but was able to still hit my weekly mileage that week. The week after, I got a nasty sinus infection and missed another long run (planned 10 miler) as a result. I had originally planned on running an 11 mile long run but knowing this wasn't necessary, picked up with a 9 mile long run and then peaked at 10 miles. The 9 miler was ROUGH after skipping two long runs in a row, but I got through it and the 10 miler went really well.\n\nFor my last two long runs, I practiced my pacing for the 11-miler, starting conservatively for the first 3 miles, going to goal race pace for the middle 5 miles, and then doing what I can to add speed the last 3 miles. One of the biggest killers of my SF half was not having the legs for the hills and given that the Big Sur course is similarly hilly to the City half, I prioritized hills in my training, always starting the first hill uphill and doing at least half my miles uphill. \n\nI tapered the last two weeks, which worked out well, considering it coincided with traveling. I got less runs in than I wanted during my taper (just two 5 milers and three 3 milers), but reminded myself that I already put in the work and the goal of the taper is recovery.\n\nGoing into the race, my practice long runs indicated that a 10:10-10:20/mile pace would be realistic. I decided to start with a conservative B goal of 10:30s and an optimistic A goal of 10:00s.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI arrived in Monterey on Saturday and went to the expo to get my bib and bus ticket. I also started getting seriously concerned about the weather forecast, which was very different than what I anticipated. They were having something of a cold front for this time of year and the projected starting temp was in the low to mid 40s, peaking in the low 50s during the race. There was also a significant chance of rain, which hadn't been anticipated. I picked up a rain hat and gloves at the expo (and was VERY glad I did).\n\nSince the Big Sur Marathon is run on Highway 1 and shuts it down, for the 11 miler, you are pretty much required to stay in Monterey and take one of the race shuttles in order to successfully get to the start line. I stayed at the Hyatt, which is a 5 minute drive from the Expo and bus pick up zone, but if I had to do it again, I would stay at the Marriott, which is walkable to both (literally across the street). \n\nThe shuttle check in was at 5:30AM, so on race morning, I woke up at 4:15AM with all of my gear already laid out. I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and left at 5:05AM. I got to the shuttle at 5:25AM and we immediately departed. It was about a 45 minute drive on the shuttle and started pouring on our way over. We got dropped off at 6:10AM, 50 minutes before race start at 7AM. I was glad I decided to overprepare and wear a long sleeve, Sweatshirt, and rain shell with rain hat and gloves since the starting area was literally a pasture with no cover. I ate a bagel I had brought with me because I need to eat about 30 minutes before running (they did provide coffee which was nice). I waited until the last possible second to shed my rain gear for gear check at 6:45AM. I then used the bathroom and tried to warm up a little (don't expect to do a warm up run, it's a small pasture - I just did some dynamic stretching trying not to slip in the mud).\n\nThere are no corrals, so I just lined up with everyone else and they had us go in packs. We started on time and off we went!\n\n\\### Race\n\nThe race starts uphill immediately, which felt very familiar due to my training and was no problem, but I immediately saw other folks struggle out the start. I felt really fresh and the rain had temporarily stopped, so I got out to a quicker start than I anticipated, but knew it wasn't too fast that I would be cooked later. I went by RPE (4 out of 10) and made sure my first 3 miles felt easy - even though it poured the entire 2nd mile, which I actually tried to have fun with. It was still clear enough to see all the views though! The hills were rolling throughout the whole course and I slowed down about 20-30 seconds/mile on the hills, keeping to same perceived effort. \n\nAfter 3 miles, I decided to pick up to race pace effort, which is about a 6 out of 10 for me. It didn't end up resulting in much a pace increase, but I was able to comfortably maintain the fast pace I set out with. I take one Clif Blok every 20-30 minutes and found I needed them every 20 minutes. At about mile 5, I started feeling hungry, but fortunately, all of the aid stations (every 2 miles) had oranges, bananas, electrolytes, etc., so I downed a half a banana while maintaining pace at mile 6. \n\nI felt really strong going into my last 4 miles (and you hit a pretty significant downhill right at the end of mile 7), so I decided to go all out and just push as hard as I could until the end, knowing there was only one more hill. All of the Big Sur Marathon races end in the same place (12K, 11 miler, 21 miler, and marathon) and I ended up seeing my friend running the 12K at my mile 9, which gave me a good boost. The hardest hill of the race is a steep climb from 9.5-10 miles and I just held on for dear life, until finally hitting flat road for the last mile.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI exceeded all of my goals and finished with an average mile time of 9:48/mile and running below 10:30 for every mile. The course was absolutely beautiful and a really fun yet challenging run. It was also one of the best organized races I've ever been to, regarding gear check, aid stations, transportation, etc. I felt super proud of how my training paid off this go around. My goal is still to get back to my previous paces of 8:30-9 minute miles, but I felt this was a triumphant return to running.\n\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "Race report:\n\nRace Information:\n* Name: Greater St. Louis Half Marathon \n* Date: April 26th, 2025\n* Time: 2:05:35\nGoals:\nA: Finish without walking - Succeeded!\nB: Sub 2:30 - Succeeded!\nC: Strech goal, Sub 2:20 - Succeeded! \n\nSplits by mile:\n1: 09:54\n2: 10:25\n3: 10:35\n4: 10:09\n5: 09:37\n6: 09:33\n7: 09:29\n8: 09:45\n9: 10:01\n10: 09:16\n11: 09:04\n12: 09:13\n13: 08:13\n.1: 01:45\n\nBackground/Training: (M30)\nI only started running last fall when I was preparing for my first 5k, and also getting back into playing soccer. I attempted to follow more traditional training routines but while I wasn\u2019t successful in doing so, I did work hard to do at least one to two runs each week building up distance in small bits at a time. I learned a lot more about proper stretching and invested in a roller bar to deal with IT band issues (that bar is a lifesaver for that). During the winter I ran in two running series that ran every other week so I got plenty of running in and each race increased in distance as well with the Snowball and Frostbite series however the furthest we ran in those was around 5 miles or so. I decided to up the stakes by running my first 10k with the Bootlegger trail race and that really pushed me to increase my weekly running distance to around 9-10 miles a week attempting at least one long run during that week. After successfully completing that I realized that I kinda like this running thing and I was ready for the next step by signing up for the St. Louis half marathon. From here I got much more serious about how much I\u2019d run each week, trying to run at least 3-4 days a week and pushing myself to run a longer PR  distance run once a week, my furthest run being a 9.8 mile jog around my very hilly town. The marathon was only two weeks away at that point so I started working myself down to slightly shorter distances with each run but trying to keep my total distance ran each week to around 15-20 miles. The last several days leading up to the run included a short 2.5 mile run and playing a few games of soccer, a lot of focus on stretching and getting my diet a bit better than what it had been.\n\nRace Day Morning: \nI live about an hour from the city so I had to wake up quite early at around 4am. I did a bit of stretching at home before the drive and was getting a bit of fluids down. I arrived at the race around 5:50am and did more stretching and a super short warmup run and than relaxed with some new friends I had made who offered me some rice cakes with peanut butter and honey which was hugely appreciated after they found out that I hadn\u2019t eaten anything yet. I usually don\u2019t eat before a race because I don\u2019t want to deal with potential digestion issues during the run but the race cake did very well, and gave me a bit of energy later on! At 6:45am I made my way to corral G and did some more last minute stretches and jumping on my toes to stay warmed up. \n\nRace: \nI knew from the start that I wanted to hang out with the 10:30 pace runners but somehow managed to start off a bit faster than that. By mile 2 though I fell into what I thought was a good rhythm but I was doubting the time the pace team was holding because we were consistently running faster than 10:30. Thanks to my warm ups before the race, I had no issues with any early pains and my legs felt great! Around miles 3 and 4 we ran under the Arch which was incredible (I have visited it several times before but this was somehow even better). At mile 5 or so I felt comfortable speeding up just a bit and started slowly moving ahead of the pace team, and I know found myself hanging out with the 2:15 pace runners. I ran with them until around mile 10 and from here on I started passing a lot of people, and quickly passed the 2:10, and even 2:05 pace teams. At this point though I could feel my left ankle and right knee talking to me but it was fairly minor discomfort and nothing that could make me slow down. I\u2019m amazed at this point that I have managed to run this entire distance only walking momentarily at a few of the water stations, and the thought creeps into my head that I may actually run this entire thing! This was a bit of a dangerous thought though as I was strongly considering walking for a bit, but I had already passed mile 12 and knew I was so close so I pushed on. I never saw the mile 13 marker but the finish line was now in site, and for the last quarter mile I moved into a full on sprint, and crossed the finish line. \n\nPost Race: \nI somehow managed to stop myself after the last second sprint and took in what I just went through, but I only had a moment to do so as I was quickly handed my finisher medal, and more snacks and drinks than I could almost carry! I was practically in a dazed high walking out of the finishers row and into the after party space. As I walked to started taking a mental checklist of how I was feeling, my left ankle definitely was a bit sore and I really needed to get my right leg massaged out as my knee was really talking to me now. But more than anything I could feel the weight of the medal around my neck, and just felt super proud of myself. I have never run this far, especially without stopping. \n\nMy thoughts on the race itself:\nThe course was altered due to a few sinkholes that opened up last week or so, but I was happy with the changes they made. It was incredible running though and around downtown St. Louis, and the streets south of the city. There were so many amazing people along the way cheering us on, and it was awesome reading the signs they made, and so many of the were very funny - toe nails are indeed overrated! I give virtually all credit to me running the entire thing without walking to the people along the way cheering us on. Pot holes and cracks in the road were ever present especially outside of downtown, but the people I ran with were super friendly and we worked together to make sure they were pointed out as we passed them, on that note I made so many great friends along the way and I just had such a good time, especially being my first HM. Next year? I\u2019m aiming to run the full!",

In 2017 I was diagnosed with MS - almost 8 years ago to the day of the Boston Marathon, when I woke up one morning unable to feel temperature in my right leg and significant weakness throughout my left side. As part of facing my new reality, I new I needed to focus on fitness getting healthier, two things proven to help slow the progression of the disease. It was a slow process of ramping up mileage and starting to adapt to running again, and about two years ago I ran my first Half Marathon as a training run, aiming to be near 1:45. I remember at that time thinking how incredibly difficult that run was, and wondering if I could ever run a marathon. Nevertheless, I started training and eventually ran my first marathon last May, the Vermont City Marathon in a time of 3:26. I had a great time, and was fortunate to get a charity bib for the Berlin Marathon in September, completing that in a time of 3:08. Earlier in the year, I had decided that I wanted to try and run Boston, knowing I was pretty far away from a BQ but recognizing that I was in decent shape and with an uncertain future - I signed up as an Adaptive Athlete as part of the Para Athlete program. This involved submitting documentation of my MS diagnosis and some info on my \"qualifier\", a different criterium than the standard BQ process. I figured that I should try and run Boston now, while I still can run, as I could have another MS flare at any time and lose the ability to run.\n\n## Training\n\nAfter Berlin I was feeling in pretty good shape, despite a bout of Post-tibial Tendonitis that sidelined me for about 3 weeks (I hobbled across the finish line and could barely walk for the next 4-5 days). As I eased back into running, I raced my first ever HM on a hilly course with a time of 1:29:22. This was my first sub-90 HM, which I was pretty pleased with despite coming off of injury. I continued to base build, running about 40-50mpw for the rest of 2024, thinking that maybe...just maybe...I could shoot for sub-3 at Boston. Going into 2025, I decided to try and do Pfitz 18/70; I really enjoy the discipline required for the Pfitz plan, previous doing the 12/55 then 18/55 plans for my first two marathons. I found that the increased mileage was a lot to deal with and in hindsight I wasn't quite ready for it. I hit a few weeks of 65+ miles before developing some tendonitis issues in my right hamstring and right ankle that massively sidetracked my training for the rest of the block.\n\nAround the time of my injury I also came down with the flu, when I recovered I stupidly did a big week and blew up. My ankle was shot. I tried to take a few weeks easy, decreasing my mileage, while starting PT. I found that if I dropped the speedwork I was able to ease into my runs and at least keep some of the volume up. For me, this was a big frustration because I really need to push speedwork and strength training to keep my MS symptoms at bay. I am very prone to neuromuscular fatigue, and if I don't keep at the speedwork then I have a lot of neurological issues with my left leg in particular. Still, I was able to run a bit, and that was enough to keep some of the training in motion. Over the course of the block my weekly mileage was 47, 56, 56, 60, 64, 63, 50 (flu), 40, 67, 44, 14 (injury), 55, 54, 52, 58, 46, 40, 26, 18. By this point I had mostly given up on Pfitz, even the 18/55 plan, and was just loosely following it and running on vibes.\n\nAbout 1-1.5 months out from Boston I had to make a decision: drop my goal of a PR and maybe sub-3, or try to push through the injury and see if my increased strength and fitness + PT will give me enough of an edge to recover into the taper. I chose to run through the injury. Four weeks out, I ran my longest run of the block, 23 miles at around a 7:10 pace and started to introduce some light speed work. It felt pretty good and I found once I warmed up I could run through the ankle pain without it getting much worse. Three weeks out, I ran a 21 mile long run with about 12 at MP through the Newton Hills. This felt pretty good, albeit a very tough workout. Two weeks out I raced a 15K tune-up racing, netting a new 10K PR of 38:25 and an overall time of 58:35. I was feeling pretty good, I was maybe on track for sub-3 pace, even though my weekly mileage was a bit low. I started a pretty hard taper, hoping my injuries would resolve by race day.\n\n\n## Pre-Race\n\nI live in the Boston area, so things were pretty easy for me. I respond very well to high carb fueling, and started loading on Friday with 600g of carbs. Saturday I took in 700g of carbs, and as a shakeout I ran the BAA 5K with some friends. It was a great atmosphere and I kept it pretty easy, 2 miles at MP. Sunday I didn't run at all, and consumed about 600g of carbs. I went to bed around 9:30pm and woke up at 3:30am, unable to sleep any longer. I ate a banana and a bagel and drove into Boston at 6am to catch the bus over to Hopkinton. \n\n## Race\n\nBecause of my \"Adaptive Athlete\" status, I was automatically put into Wave 1 Corral 8. This ended up working out pretty well for me, as I was aiming for around a 3hr marathon, which was right on pace for this group. The weather was good, not great - I'd say maybe a 7/10. The sun was intense and I burned pretty bad during the race. The energy was electric but I was feeling pretty calm and eager to get underway. I remember reading two comments on Reddit a few days earlier \"Please please please save something for the Newton Hills\" and \"Aim for high cadence after Heartbreak so you don't wreck your quads going towards Cleveland Circle\". I did my best to keep this in mind, but still went out a bit too fast at around a 6:35-6:40 pace. The first 6-8 miles dragged by, I actually didn't find them particularly easy; I don't know if I wasn't feeling it or not but I was feeling a bit sluggish and labored from the start.\n\nI kept pace and was enjoying the crowd energy as we came up to the half - 1:28 on my watch. A bit fast, but not too bad. I was a little nervous for what was to come and slowed up just a little. The next 3-4 miles starting feeling pretty rough...I think the heat was getting to me. I saw my family at 16, right after the big downhill going into Newton, right as my left quad was starting to really hurt. We began the hills, and it was actually a bit of a relief, as using some new muscles felt great after so much downhill to that point. I was tired, but knew I just had to get through Newton. I've run the hills maybe 2-3 times in training and was actually most worried about the 1st and 3rd hill. I wasn't wrong; these were very tough and I was starting to hurt pretty bad.\n\nAfter Heartbreak, the wheels came off. I've never cramped up before, so this was a new experience for me. I started to feel a slight shock/twinge in my calf and then it would completely lock up for a split second. I was just hoping every single step that I could straddle the line without it locking up completely. My fueling was great, and I started taking in more gatorade, hoping the extra carbs and electrolytes might help. Every step was a cramp and agony in my left quad as I pushed to the finish.\n\nThe rest of the race is pretty much a blur. I recall seeing the Citgo sign, thinking it was so, so far away, wondering if I should stop and stretch, questioning how much I really cared about going sub-3 anyway. At one point I looked at my watch and it was predicting a 3:01 and I almost stopped then and there. I pushed forward and didn't even notice the little dip under the overpass, trying to pick up the pace. Right on Hereford, left on Boylston. My watch told me I was now going to be around 2:59:30. Everyone says running on Boylston is a transcendent experience and frankly, it was terrible. All I could do was push forward as hard as I could. Stretch for the finish...2:59:25 on my watch. BQ.\n\nI am extremely satisfied for going sub-3, something I thought would never even be possible a few years ago. I'm really proud of the accomplishment and the journey to get here. Some things went really well, my nutrition was on point (275g carbs total taken in during the race), which is why I think I didn't bonk completely. My pacing and strategy could have been better but my splits weren't too bad all things considered. Did I enjoy the experience? I think so, but I'm still processing it all. I'll certainly come back to Boston, maybe next year, but I'm not sure yet. I think if I do I won't grind for a big PR and instead try and soak up this iconic race more than I could on Monday. I'm not entirely sure what is next. I'm signed up for the NYC Marathon, but I may defer until next year, and I have some shorter distance things over the summer. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

For those that dont know, these muscles **run on the outside of your lower leg up to the knee, and attach centrally in your lower foot arch.** \n\nAnd sure enough, despite feeling the pain only in deep in my right foot arch, simply pressing on the peroneal muscles confirmed they were very tender and stiff!\n\nI found that **foam-rolling the area and stretching** by siting in half-lotus postions releived in 24 hours much of the arch-pain that I had been having for weeks!\n\nApparently, the peroneal muscle is responsible for the angle of your feet, if this muscles becomes tired it can supposedly create \"duck feet\".  \n\nThis kind of blindsided me. I have never heard of this, anddepsite religously training strength \"for runners\" twice a week for running and often stretching and foam-rolling my calves, I have probably not been adressing these muscles. \n\nNow in addition to foam rolling and stretching, I will also use a **band to move the sole of my feet sideways both inwards and outwards against load to strengthen it,** as it is apperanelty a muscle that is too weak. \n\nNote that this is an ankle that I have previously had a pretty **bad ankle sprain** on. \n\nHope someone finds this information useful. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I tried to run before, I really liked the feeling right after the run, but after a couple of days my back started to hurt and I quit. This time I started classes as part of a program for the local community with a professional coach. And in recent days, I've been having thoughts: I hated running as a teenager, and all because they didn't teach us how to run properly at my school. I don't understand why children aren't taught proper running techniques and proper stretching as part of the school program (I asked few friends, they had exactly the same thing). I think I would have started running much earlier if I had learned how to run properly. It turns out that your back may not hurt from running! It turns out that you can breathe easily, even if you run for 15 minutes in a row! All these discoveries have appeared in my life in the last week and seriously, having a coach makes a big difference in your training.",

I've run less than 200 miles in them.\n\nAnyone else with this dual problem? Do I just have to accept the toe problem or are there *actually shoes that help with this? Wide toe boxes don't solve it.\n\nWhile I'm interested in running a half marathon someday, I need to strengthen some muscles and joints as I'm hypermobile and my body doesnt love long runs. Maybe strength is a thing related to this too?",

I imagine many are in the same boat- spent the last 5 months training and flew to Indiana this weekend. No other marathon quite fits my schedule and it will be hard for me to continue training with the upcoming travel I have and starting medical school in July. I am feeling absolutely gutted. I was considering running the 26 on my own tomorrow, but that's essentially what I did for my first marathon (there were only 80 participants and no spectators), and I was really excited to see what I could do with pacers/ adrenaline/overall better vibes. Anyone ever have this experience before and have any words of wisdom? Or anyone want to rip a marathon with me tomorrow lol.. kidding.........",

When I finished my studies in August 2023, I decided to commit to running properly. Already then, I had in mind to eventually run a marathon, but wanted to do a half marathon first to figure out whether I enjoyed the process. I ended up running a 01:32:12 at the Zurich Half Marathon in April 2024. Finishing feeling like I still had something in the tank, I got hooked \u2013 and immediately registered for the the Zurich Marathon in April 2025.\n\n**Preparation**  \nTraining officially kicked off in mid-October after a summer spent mostly on the road bike. The first month was all about rebuilding my running base with lots of easy Zone 2 miles.\n\nThe \"proper\" training started with 21 weeks to go. I used a training plan out of the book *Science of Running* ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Running-Technique-Revolutionize-Training/dp/1465489576)). The plan itself was quite standard with three main sessions per week: one interval, one tempo, one long run. I filled the days between those sessions with Zone 2 runs. Thus, I ran 4 to 5 times in most weeks with an average weekly mileage of 61 km (38 mi) and a peak of 85 km (53 mi).\n\nOriginally, based on my half marathon time, I aimed for a 3:20:00 marathon. But my Garmin race predictor kept trending lower, eventually dipping under 3 hours. Well knowing this is more of a guesstimate than an exact science, it still got me thinking. Eight weeks out, I decided to pivot toward sub-3 training, adjusting the training paces accordingly. To get a second opinion on the feasibility of this goal, I also started using ChatGPT in a very similar manner as suggested by another user on r/Marathon_Training in a recent post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/s/EORfOfPHji)).\n\n**Taper**  \nMy two-week taper was tough. I felt gassed out the first  week. Anxious I would not be fully recovered by race day, I decided to only do two runs. In the last week before the race, I felt slow, heavy, and sluggish during every run. My confidence took a big hit \u2013 I was doubtful whether the taper was actually working and my goal remained feasible.\n\nCarb loading in particular was challenging. I started out three days before the race with the goal of getting in 10-12 g carbs/kg. Next to rice, pasta, and potatoes, I relied on sports drinks, gels, smoothies, juice, soda pops, rice cakes. Eating that much just contributed to the general feeling of sluggishness. In hindsight, I should have taken in more carbs through drinks instead of solid food.\n\n**Pre-race**  \nThe night before the race was rough: I managed to fall asleep at 11:30 pm and got up at 05:00 am to have some pasta and a sports beverage for breakfast. I arrived at the start line at 07:00 am. At 07:30 am, I took one last gel and a caffeine shot of 200mg. At 08:00 am, I was ready at the start line.\n\n**Race**  \nMy race plan was to run a negative split using Garmin\u2019s PacePro: starting at 4:24 min/km (7:05 min/mi) and finishing around 4:01 min/km (6:28 min/mi). I intentionally started behind the 3:00 pacer for space \u2014 hoping to reel them in later.\n\nThe **first few kilometres** went smoothly, although my right tibialis was cranky early on. Luckily, it settled down once I got into rhythm. My heart rate was high from the start (caffeine + adrenaline), but it dropped slightly later even as I sped up.\n\nThe **first half** flew by. Between managing pace, weaving through groups, and executing my fueling plan, I stayed busy.\u00a0Nutrition-wise, I stuck to one cup (200-250 ml) of the sports beverage offered at the overall 12 aid stations. In doing so, I could make sure I got in the recommended 1-1.5 g carbs/kg/h and hydrate at the same time, without having to take a gel AND water at every station. I had already practiced similar carb intakes during my training, where I once had also hit the wall \u2013 so I knew what I had to avoid at all costs.\n\nAt **28 km** (17 mi), things started to bite. I could still hold my paces, but my quads started hurting. When I passed **30 km** (18.6 mi), holding my pace targets became difficult and I slowly started eating into the buffer I had built. With **35 km** (21.7 mi) to go, it became a mental game. The kilometres seemed to tick down slower and I felt that the paces I wanted to hit were just a tit out of reach. Therefore, I started to be unsure about my goal time. To aid with the discomfort in my quads, I took a caffeinated gel at an aid station.\n\nIn my head though, I started to visualise how crossing the finish line would feel like \u2013 just how I had done many times before during training. I told myself that I had come so far, had dedicated so much time and effort to this goal, that I would not just relinquish. I focused on keeping the pace I was at, without trying to think too much about the planned paces \u2013 in the end, I was not that far off. Around this point, I also caught up with the 3h pacer, which gave me a boost, just as coming back into the city with the crowd cheering \u2013 including my girlfriend and mom.\n\nWhen I reached **38 km** (23.6 mi), I knew that sub 3 would be possible. For the final kilometres, I ran by feeling, just trying to push as much as was still possible. When I crossed the finish line, I could not believe what had just happened: in the end, six months of training came down to not even 3 hours.\n\n**Aftermath**  \nThe moment I stopped running, my legs were jelly. I managed to find my mom and girlfriend before sitting down \u2013 a wise move, because after that, I physically couldn\u2019t get up without help!\n\nAfter getting home, taking a hot bath and applying some cooling gel, things were already going better. However, for the rest of the day as well as the next, I could only go down stairs backwards. I felt like I was 80 years old, having to hold onto things to get up and get down. Recovery went fairly well tough, and by the third day, I could already run a little bit to at least catch the bus.\n\n**Final thoughts**  \nI am really happy I could follow through with my training and the race itself, especially without injuries. Pushing for sub 3 in my first marathon definitely was not the smartest move: apart from the lack of experience of what it is actually like to pace and race a marathon, adapting my training plan that far into the block should, by itself, be a no-no. In addition, my weekly mileage was on the lower end of what one would expect for such a goal time.\n\nThat being said, I am still glad I pushed myself to go for it. In the end, this is exactly what fascinates me about endurance sports: pushing yourself over the limits you thought you were bound by. I feel like there is not much that I left on track, and this is exactly how I wanted to finish my marathon. I am absolutely certain that this will not have been my last, and I am already eyeing one next year.",

    "title": "Vienna City Marathon Race Report - 3rd marathon and another PR",
    "selftext": "# Race Information\n\n* Name: Vienna City Marathon\n* Date: 6th April 2025\n* Distance: 42km\n* Location: Vienna, Austria\n* Time: 3:22 (PR, 3:47 in 2024, 4:20 in 2023)\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|Sub 3:30|Yes|\n|B|Do not hit the wall|Yes|\n|C|Sub 3:20|No|\n\n# Training\n\nI followed the 55-mile 12-week programme from Advanced Marathoning, starting from mid-January. It appealed to me due to the relatively high focus on mid to long-distance workouts, something that I felt was missing from my previous 2 marathon plans (also I loved the book itself). 2 years ago I opted for a basic Hal Higdon plan with no idea about training zones or workout types, and last year I used the Runna app which was unnecessarily heavy on short HIIT runs.\n\nThe plan kicked off with a 56k week and I was ready for it after consistently cycling and running since my last event in November (500-700 TSS/wk, mostly Z2). Following some customisation every week looked roughly like this:\n\n* Mon - Strength training, sometimes bike\n* Tue - Workout or base run, depending on feel/time\n* Wed - Workout or base run, depending on feel/time\n* Thu - Recovery run or bike\n* Fri - Strength (in early blocks), carb loading\n* Sat - Long run\n* Sun - Bike\n\nI did significant cross-training on the bike on top of the plan, sometimes replacing recovery runs with a ride when my legs felt particularly battered. I also did some strength training focused on core and upper body, initially 2 and later 1 session per week (30-40min). These seem to have helped with the mild lower back pain that I felt after a couple of hours during long runs, on top of some general improvements in core strength and posture. \n\nThings went well. I found the training challenging but manageable, completed all key sessions as planned whatever the weather, with particular focus on executing the long runs. Overall I trained 9-11 hours or 600-800 TSS per week and felt more fatigued than ever by the end of the peak period. Staying focused during the long runs and long interval sessions seemed to be the biggest challenge, my brain is not great at monotonous activities (one reason why I am more keen on cycling).\n\nThe taper period lasted 2 weeks. I did not reduce the intensity of training runs by that much, but dropped the volume by around 2h and spent some more time on the bike instead. Overall the weekly TSS only dropped by around 100.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI flew to Vienna on Friday morning and spent the next couple of days exploring the city at a relaxed pace, taking every opportunity to take on some carbs (Vienna has the best cakes I ever ate) and make use of their amazing public transport. I managed to fit in a touristy 30min run on Saturday morning.\n\nSunday morning was bloody cold. The temperature dropped by more than 10C in a day, down to around freezing and with horrible wind chill. Fuelled by a supersized portion of my standard workout day breakfast (oats with yoghurt and bread with jam + sliced banana) and wrapped in 3 layers of clothing I made my way to the start line on the other side of Danube.\n\n# Race\n\nApart from the crowdy first few km and my legs gradually shutting down towards the end, I managed to maintain a very consistent pace, HR and cadence (around 4:45/km in bottom half of Z3, 174spm). I did not hit the wall or stop at any point which I am particularly proud of. Sticking to a slightly lower HR than on previous attempts probably played a big role here.\n\nIt felt like there was some energy left to speed up in the last few km but I couldn't, my legs were cooked and forcing them for the sake of gaining a few seconds seemed like a recipe for injury. It was clear that the stretch 3:20 target is out of reach at that point and I just focused on maintaining the consistent effort. Last couple of splits were still under 5:00/km.\n\nNutrition plan worked well. I took on 35-40g of carbs every 30min with a mixture of homemade energy balls, glucose/fructose gels, and simpler glucose gels later on. I also went through 1L of water with electrolytes.\n\nI was initially worried about the chilly conditions but felt surprisingly comfortable once warmed up. I opted for a base layer, heavier long sleeve shirt, leggings + shorts, and a few extras which only slightly reduced my shaking in the first couple of km (light wind breaker, neck tube, gloves).\n\nThe course was amazing overall, I found it easier and way more interesting than Manchester which I have completed twice before. It made me want to come back and explore the city properly in the near future. Running full length of the Hauptallee park for 2nd time was a bit monotonous so late in the race, but I can see why Kipchoge picked this place to run a sub-2:00 marathon (over 4km in a dead straight line).\n\n# Post-race\n\nMy joints seized after crossing the finish line, followed by burning in every leg muscle soon after which stayed with me for another 2-4 days. This was definitely the furthest I ever pushed my legs, I shuffled through the event village with great pain and even the gentles attempts to stretch resulted in a cramp. A couple of days after the event I started feeling some deep pain in my right glute and hamstring (deep gluteal syndrome?), however it began to subside before I decided to see a physio. One to watch out for in the future. \n\nI rate the event 5*, it was very well executed and felt like a big deal with generous sponsors. It was just another level compared to what I am used to running in the UK.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the result as well, despite finishing just under the stretch goal. Will I run another marathon? Yes, maybe next year. Will I try to finish under 3:00? Not saying no but that would be a massive undertaking, running at 4:15/km for 3h will need *a lot* of consistent training and it feels like the returns for my efforts have already slowed dramatically in recent months, despite being fitter than ever. Maybe this plan would need breaking down into 2 season. Or maybe I will switch to trail ultras after following the UTMB series with great interest lately? Who knows.",

    "selftext": "> Meanwhile, Runna burst onto the scene in 2021 and has quickly climbed the app charts for folks in need of 5K, 10K, or marathon training plans. Since launch, it\u2019s secured an additional $6.3 million in funding for its AI-powered run coaching, with users spanning 180 countries. In 2024, Runna also tripled the size of its team and is currently hiring roughly 50 roles to expand the product and tech\n\n> \u201cFor a while, Strava had created static, document-based plans for runners but the reality is those were used very, very infrequently,\u201d Strava CEO Michael Martin says. According to the company\u2019s research, the lack of guidance was a pain point for longtime users and newcomers to the app. \u201cWe came to realize that, as it related to runners, that guidance was training plans.\u201d\n\n> \u201cEffectively, nothing changes for the user out of the gate. Our plan with this acquisition is to invest further into growing the Runna app, invest in the Runna team, and then continue to operate them as independent but in an integrated fashion,\u201d Martin says, adding that once the deal is fully wrapped, users can expect to start seeing changes in the coming weeks and months.\n\n> \u201cThe ambition is to do things where it makes sense,\u201d adds Runna cofounder and CEO Dom Maskell, who notes a more seamless integration between the two apps would help create a smoother user experience. \u201cIt\u2019s like, the user comes on and they want to see what run they\u2019re doing today. That sits in Runna, and then they want to go find a route for that run \u2014 that sits in Strava. Then, if they want live coaching, that\u2019s on Runna and then Strava frankly has better tech than us for recording on your phone. At the moment, the user kind of gets passed off quite a lot of times.\u201d\n\n> One thing that hasn\u2019t been decided yet is how subscriptions will work. Strava has a free tier but charges $79.99 a year for premium features, while Runna costs $119.99 annually. While Runna currently uses Strava\u2019s third-party API, until the details are hammered out, users will still need to subscribe to both services to get the full range of features.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite an active Reddit community, and I know there\u2019s probably quite a large overlap between them and the strong voices in the comment section,\u201d says Maskell. \u201cWe try to be very transparent and open with them, and I genuinely believe this is an amazing thing for all users. I\u2019m happy to tell everyone about it and sit on Reddit for the whole day to answer everyone\u2019s questions.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/tech/648075/strava-runna-acquisition-running-fitness-tech",

Who here suffers from \"exertion headaches\"(...or more like \"exertion pickaxes through the skull\") after long training runs??  \n\n\nI just realized this is likely what I'm experiencing and I'd like to hear what others' experience is.whatbare they like for you? How often do you get them, and why do you think so? What do you do to prevent/ address them?\n\n\nAnd if you just want to complain - I'm totally down for that lol. I'm all for an empathy chamber - these things are terrible!  Or am I the only nutso one that keeps running anyway and therefore needs one?? :D\n\n(FYI I don't mean dehydration headaches. Those are also terrible!!  But they also seem at least a little more comprehensible to me and I'd love to hear what other people's experiences of exertion headaches are).",

It's genuinely my favourite way to explore a new city\n\nBut... actually\u00a0finding\u00a0a good route can be a real pain sometimes\n\nMy usual process is a bit clunky:\n\n* **Strava Heatmaps:**\u00a0Great for seeing where\u00a0other\u00a0people run, but doesn't easily give me a specific\u00a0route\u00a0of a specific distance, especially a loop starting and ending at my random Airbnb.\n* **Google Maps/Street View:**\u00a0So much guesswork. Is this road actually runnable? Is it safe? Is it going to be fumes-ville? Takes ages.\n* **Asking the Hotel:**\u00a0Sometimes helpful, sometimes they look at me like I'm mad for wanting to run 10k before breakfast and suggest a lap around the block.\n\nWhat I\u00a0really\u00a0struggle with is getting a reliable loop of a specific distance (say, exactly 10k, or maybe a longer 20k for a weekend trip) that starts and finishes right back at my accommodation. I hate ending up miles away and having to navigate back tired, or doing weird out-and-backs just to hit my target mileage.\n\nI feel like this must be a common problem for runners who travel frequently. How do you all handle it? Am I missing some obvious tool or trick? Or are you secretly using some magic AI route-generating app I need to know about?!\n\nWould love to hear your strategies and any app recommendations you have!\n\nThanks in advance! Happy running!",

Been working with a coach since the fall of 2022. Half marathon progression:\n\nMay 2022 - first half: 1:52\n\nSeptember 2022 - poor training, no idea what I was doing: 1:56\n\nApril 2023 - first race with my coach's help, but didn't listen properly to the pacing and went out too hard: 1:49\n\nMarch 2024 - first race post NYC marathon injury, learned how to race and pace properly: 1:52\n\nApril 2024 - decently hilly race, 2 loops of Central Park, everything clicked: 1:47\n\nMy half marathons in 2024 were pretty solid, I had pretty large negative splits that made my coach think that I probably had more to give in the half, plus I now had a whole extra year of training under my belt, and Jersey City is a flat course.\n\nMy last race was the Berlin Marathon in September of 2024, where I came away with a 36 minute PR, so I knew I had gained a considerable amount of fitness since the last time I raced a half. But this training block had a few bumps along the road. I had a minor calf strain in the beginning of February due to my own stupidity by running at a bachelorette party where I was not properly taking care of my body. Luckily, it was very short-lived and I only missed a couple of runs. At the end of March, I came down with bronchitis. Doctor said it was the very early stages, thankfully and I missed about 10 days of training, plus a 10k race that I was supposed to do leading up to the half. This ended up being the right decision, as I didn't want to jeopardize my chances of running a good half. Coming back to running took a little longer than I expected, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get frustrated. We began to wonder if I'd even be able to run the half at all and started looking at backups for later in the month. But eventually, everything fell into place, although this definitely made me a lot more nervous for the race, knowing that I had missed a bit of training. My coach insisted that my consistency up until this point made more of a difference than missing a few training sessions, so I trusted her! I felt extra nervous, though, not having raced in about 7 months.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nSlept alright the night before and woke up to my alarm at 4:50 am. I had my breakfast of toast and a banana, got ready, and jogged over to the start as I live in walking distance. I got in a few strides and warmup drills and before I knew it, it was time to line up. It looked like the rain was going to hold off, which I was happy about. The weather was about 34 degrees with a bit of wind and no sun, so a little cold waiting at the start but really, near perfect race weather. I will take the cold over the heat any day! I didn't feel great for whatever reason on my jog over (maybe it was just in my head) so I started preparing for the fact that it may not be my day today, and that's ok.\n\n\\### Race\n\nThe plan was to hover around the low 8 - 8:10 range for the first 9 miles, and then for the last 4, go for it with whatever I had left - ideally, somewhere around a sub 8 pace but \"don't limit yourself to that\". This is typically how my coach paces it out for me with elapsed time at a couple of splits, and I had done pretty well executing this on my last few races (after learning my lesson from my first half working with her!). I was a couple of seconds faster than intended on some of these early miles but I trusted my gut and went with it, as it felt pretty good and I wasn't crazy off like I had been in the past. The miles were actually flying by, even during the middle of the race (6-8) where sometimes, I find it can be a bit of a mental struggle. I saw a few people say they had issues with the course being crowded but I personally didn't experience this at all, other than a little on the first half a mile or so. Anyway, the pace felt good, comfortably hard, but I grew increasingly nervous (as I always do) about mile 9 approaching. I questioned if I'd really be able to pick it up for these last 4 miles. Even though I wasn't struggling at this point, it seemed daunting.\n\nSlight incline around mile 8, nothing bad, but noticeable given how flat the rest of the course is. But I stayed on track. Before I knew it, I hit mile marker 9. Here we go! When I saw my pace in the 7:20 ish range, I thought, \"there is absolutely no way I can hold onto this for 4 miles, but let me try for as long as I can\". In the back of my mind, I worried I had pushed it too hard and was going to burn out, but at this point, I figured, let's just go with it. It was already happening! It never ceases to amaze me how your mind really, truly does give up before your body does. It sounds stupid when I say it now, but I kept reminding myself, \"it's not supposed to be easy\". By the last 2 miles, I was definitely fighting for my life but I somehow held on. Sometimes when it really gets hard, I like to break it down into time chunks. So I thought to myself, \"only 15 more minutes of running\". \"Only 7 more minutes of running. You can do that\". Finally, the home stretch was approaching. I saw my husband and parents and could barely lift up my arm to wave! I gave that final push everything I had left in me, crossed the finish line, nearly fell over, and some nice volunteer helped me up lol. I was truly shocked when I saw my finish time. I knew I was probably capable of a 1:45 on the right day, but I did not think I was anywhere near a 1:43 yet. Let alone, 3 seconds away from being in the 1:42 range!\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI met up with my husband and parents, we had a nice breakfast, and then I celebrated with a few friends. I'm still riding the high 3 days later! I say it every time, the half marathon is my favorite distance to race. Next up, CIM in early December!\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

After an exhaustive amount of research and hand wringing, I decided to used Hanson's basic (not beginner) plan. I personally enjoyed this plan due to the rest day between tough workouts, flexibility, and the fact that it made me run six days a week, keeping the complacency down.\n \nI was very unsure about the LR only being 16 miles, but I have two kids under three so it was appealing; several 20 milers really takes a toll on family time, and is hard to really budget time for. That said, due to the aforementioned children being breeding grounds for illness and sleepless nights, I only completed 79% of the program - not ideal, but we do what we have to. Most of the miss came from a longer-than-prescribed taper (because one of the kids got me sick) and a week long spring break trip. Luckily spring break helped me start my carb load early, 15 beers a day will do that.\n \nI definitely wish that I would have finished more of the plan, but all in all I was pretty happy with the training block. I only missed the shorter easy runs, and hit every long run and major workout, even if they took some reorganizing. I think this contributed more to my \"success\" than sticking strictly to the schedule would have - I'm happy that I made the hard workouts, and missed some easy runs, but wish I could have 100%'d it. Also, 25 weeks injury free! Woohoo!\n \n### Race\n\"F it, we'll do it live\"\n \nFeeling a little nervous from my underwhelming training block, I decided to channel my inner Bill O'Riley and send it. Breakfast was some of my wifes amazing homemade sourdough topped with PB to finish my three day carb load, and I was loaded down with Gels. The gun was scheduled to go off at 7, so I arrived promptly at 5:00 to stretch, loosen up, and try to take my morning constitutional. I did not, in fact, get to poop.\n \n##Miles 1-5\nThese went pretty well; Hogeye is a course that gets progressively more difficult as it goes, peaking at miles 12-15. I wanted to have a negative split, so I hung with the 4:15 pacer with the plan of breaking off later. I *would* have started with the 4:00 pacer, but he sprinted away at the starting line and I never saw him again, I guess he was doing his own thing. Or maybe he robbed the actual 4:00 pacer and stole his flag, the world will never know. At Mile 5 I had my first Gu and marched on.\n \n## Miles 5-10\nMy favorite part of the course, bar none. Still hanging with the 4:15 pacer, I started to pull away at mile 7. Miles 7-10 are right by my house, and I run them every single day (which seems like cheating), so I knew exactly how hard to hit the mile 7 hill and do the mile 8.5 straightaway. Also, my wife and kids were at mile 8 which always gives me a big boost.\n \n## Miles 10-15\nHere's where things start to get. . . poopy. Around mile 11 we have the honor and privilege of running next to the Tyson slaughter house, so you can understand why that mile has a much faster split than 10/12. Mile 12 is where the hills start in earnest, rolling for the next three miles or so. Not unbearable, but I live here, so I'm quite used to NWA's rolling hills. There's around 940ft of elevation gain on the Hogeye, and most of it comes on these three miles. I kept as much of a negative split as I could here, knowing that I would need to bank some time for the inevitable code brown that met me at mile 15. Luckily, this race is very generous with the porta-johns.\n \n## Miles 15-20\nNot much to report here, the five miles after running through the baseball stadium (which is awesome!) are my least favorite. One more big hill, and then a whole lot of nothing. I was alone for most of this stretch, but got to run by my church which was cool, even if the preacher didn't notice me. The back of this stretch is where I started to feel it, with my hips tightening up at mile 18. I definitely didn't hit \"the wall\", but the dramatic elevation gain finally took its toll. Mile 20 to the end is, in my opinion, where I most suffered from my under-training.\n \n## Miles 20-26.2\nBig chilling by this point. The crowd was excellent for this part of the race, which really helped to alleviate some of the boredom/fatigue that started to set in during the mile 15 block. We hit JB hunt park around mile 23, which means a very nice down hill section. Also, mile 23-26 is by far the prettiest part of the course, even if the racers had thinned out dramatically. I ran this section several times on my longest runs, and I think that really contributed to my finish.  Although I was gunning for a negative split, I didn't completely fall off the wagon, and I'll call it success enough for my first marathon. Taking recommendations for my next, which I would like to do this fall.\n \n \nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph",

    "title": "My fix for posterior shin splints in less than a month without taking time off or decreasing my training volume",
    "selftext": "I understand that posterior shin splints can have multiple causes and are quite a complex injury to treat. In my case, I'd been dealing with them for months, and they became gradually worse as I progressed through my half marathon training progression. For reference, I got into the sport about a year ago and have been running about 20-30mpw. Would also consider myself of average height/weight with above average fitness as I also cycle and weight train quite frequently. \n\n**Type of pain / what I tried**\n\nI had posterior shin splints in both legs (the pain was specifically on the inside of my leg about 3-6 inches above my ankle) but it was significantly worse in my left. At its worst, I would feel it in my day-to-day walks, and progressed to about a 6/10 pain that sharply rattled my lower leg with every stride at the start of every run (though it would subside after about 5-10 minutes). I would then take 2-3 days off, let it heal slightly, get too inpatient, start running again, and basically let the whole process cycle over. After about 2 months of frustration, I eventually started implementing the following:\n\n1. Resistance band exercises - 15-20 mins of theraband around my foot with a focus on ankle inversion (and flexion to a lesser degree). [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjiw7u3WlRE)\n2. Foam rolling and stretching my calves more often before and after runs\n3. Massaging my posterior tibialis daily\n4. [KT tape on my foot for long or interval runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOzBKJy2JMA)\n\nAs mentioned, I was also strength training regularly and training legs about 1-2x week (heavy dumbbell squats, bulgarian split squats, hip thrusts, weighted calf raises, hip abduction machine, deadlifts). Would say all of the above had probably helped a bit (if anything, I did get much faster at running) but the pain never really improved or decreased in a meaningful/noticeable way. \n\n**What actually worked**\n\nI had a [mobo board](https://www.moboboard.com/) from a peroneal tendonitis injury a year prior that was collecting dust (the injury was related to my cycling and eventually went away). So I hardly used it and to be honest, didn't really love using it either because all of the workouts made me really uncomfortable and were just plain difficult. It was also hard to track improvements/progression which was pretty demotivating. After doing more research online about the injury, I eventually decided to give it another shot and decided to create and actually stick to a plan with the mobo board this time around. I used it consistently for close to 3 weeks and turns out it actually worked. If anything, I started seeing noticeable improvements after the 1st week with the following plan (did this about 3-4x a week):\n\n1. 1 set of [this exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz746AklSa4), odd #s, anywhere from 10-20 reps. \n2. 1 set [banded twists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3uyQgj21j0), even #s, 10-25 reps\n3. 1 set [banded pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNA_Xau6yw), even #s, 10-25 reps\n4. 1 set one-legged body weight romanian dead lifts, odd #s, 10 reps\n5. 1 set [eversion pass around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsZkLfespc)\n\nYou'll notice the rep ranges are pretty wide. I tried to be lenient here because in my experience, fighting to a specific amount of reps was usually VERY painful and unpleasant, which meant I'd be less likely to do these exercises on a consistent basis. i.e. I'd rather do these 3-4x a week with shitty reps vs. being discouraged and stopping altogether. Also worth noting that I was also still doing all of the above. This specific mobo board routine took anywhere from 15-20 minutes. \n\n**Thoughts / Theory / Disclaimer**\n\nCan promise i'm not a shill for the board, I just think it works quite well. You can probably get by without using one and attempt to replicate the above routine on your own with just the ground or maybe a balance pad. Though I'd imagine it would be hard to do as there are few ways to effectively recreate that specific type of foot balance/activation. However, if i were to guess, this probably has less to do with the board itself and more to do with simply shifting the focus away from strengthening the tibialis and more towards increasing foot strength, balance, and coordination - this makes sense for me at least, given my history of a weak foot/ankle from repeated sprains, etc. My take is also that posterior shin splints are generally caused by training load that is either 1) excessive (too much too soon/body hasn't adapted) or 2) incorrect (poor running form, foot/arch anatomy, hip weaknesses, etc). Exercises that strengthen the tibialis/shins would probably increase one's capacity to handle the load but if the load itself is less than optimal, then the former probably won't do much. The foot exercises / mobo board would target the latter in my specific case. \n\nSharing here mainly because most advice out there recommends individuals to stop running completely (or at least significantly reduce your volume) and what I did was able to circumvent that. That said, I also acknowledge that 1) my recommendations are completely anecdotal and this won't work for everyone 2) I am NOT a medical professional 3) rest & recovery is recommended probably because it WORKS and is the right thing to do 100% of the time. However, if you're stubborn like I am, and simply can't stop running ( to be fair, my mental health also deteriorates if I do), then this is probably something worth looking into. ",

Starting last August, I increased my mileage, hoping to make 30km a comfortable distance so I could participate in Montpellier Marathon in April 2025. By December, I reached a monthly peak of 240 km, and in January, I ran 30 km in under 2:30 (5:00/km pace) and felt like I could have gone further.\n\nUnbeknownst to me at the time, that was my last 30km run until today. I got caught up in traveling, attending conferences, and my mileage plummeted to about 150km a month. To make matters worse, last month was also Ramadan, the fasting month, where we abstain from drinking/eating for 18h a day. While I continued to run, most of the runs were garbage runs, around 5:50 pace. I attemped several times to go faster, but I always ended up feeling nauseated at some point. I could never go beyond 20km. For some reason, my legs always felt weak; the sort of the feeling you get when someone delivers bad news.\n\nWhen Ramadan ended, I only had two weeks left before the race; only one without fasting. My attempt at 30km at 5:00/km was a disaster; I couldn't hold the pace for more than 17 km. I considered giving it another try a few days later, but giving the proximity to the race, I decided against it.\n\nAs you can imagine, I had no idea what pace I should go for. On one hand, I haven't managed to sustain 5:00 pace for more than 18km in a long time. On the other hand, I believed I had a 3h 30min in me and it will come back at some point. Eventually, I decided to aim for a 3h 45min marathon, hoping to adapt on race day based on how I felt.\n\n**Race Day**\n\nThe marathon kicked off at 8 a.m. under a light drizzle; perfect for avoiding the usual midday heat. I rode to the marathon site and found the 3h 45min pacer. Had some chitcat with random runners to ease off the tension and the race started.\n\nI was planning to stick by the pacer for the first 10k and then assess the situation. For some reason, the pacer didn't seem to have any idea what pace he should be running and I left him. I found someone running at the desired pace and begin drifting off him.\n\nThe first 10km went really well. I was feeling better than I had felt in a long time. This obviously started giving me ideas. I started increasing the pace slightly, and by km 15, my average pace was 5:08. Excellent. I was thinking I could hold this pace until the half marathon point and then switch to a 4:45 pace until the end. That would put me just sub 3h 30min. Perfect, just what the doctor ordered. I have a 1:36 half-marathon time, so it didn't seem far-fetched.\n\nOf course, this is not how it played out. That plan fell apart so fast that I didn't realize what had hit me. At km 18, my energy vanished, and my legs turned into lead (see the table). I felt like a crash-test dummy that never got the seatbelt memo. This was so sudden. How is this possible. Oh lord, not now. At least, let me get to km 30 and then do whatever you want. But not at km 18.\n\nI kept pushing, but the realization that I'm already gassed at km 18 and I still have 24.2km crushed me completely. I considered quitting, but remembering that I've been hyping this marathon for so long that almost everyone in my lab knows I'm running it, a DNF would have been embarrassing. I was thinking of several excuses to give tomorrow, but none of them made me look good.\n\nThe determination of not failing is the only thing that kept me going. For the next 2h, with a very hilly course (see the [elevation map](https://i.imgur.com/8oyNWba.png)), it was nothing but complete torture, the kind of feeling I would never wish on my worst enemy. Then, the heavens decided to open up and turn the course into a steeplechase track. Suddenly, I am not only required to run, but jump over water puddles or risk running with wet shoes. \nJust what I have been asking for! With my tiredness, I looked like an awkward gazelle, bounding over mini-lakes I swore were installed just to watch me flail. After a few attempts, I stopped caring about the luxuries of running with dry shoes. I went right through the water puddles.\n\nI can't say much about what happened in the second half of the race because I was simply not there. Everything became a blur and I stopped seeing well at some point. My running form got so tragic that passing pigeons looked more graceful. However, I remember my brain telling me to stop and have a walk. From experience, I knew this was a trick. You simply ignore your brain when things begin going south. As soon as I stop, I would never be able to continue. So, I refused to listen to my inner mind.\n\nThe Montpellier Marathon organizers decided the best way to end the marathon is to put the finish line on top of a hill. From km 38 until the finish, the course climbed relentlessly. Even though I was just 3km away, I never believed I could finish. At that point, I would have traded anything for roller skates if it meant an easy glide to the finish. I felt like an action hero whose script forgot to include a happy ending.\n\nMy body was completely numb. I had lost sensation of my behind at some point, feeling as if my body had split into two halves. It's hard to know how I kept going, but I just kept at it. With 500m to go, and 25m of elevation, the wise words of the great philosopher Arnold Schwarzenegger suddenly popped into my head: \"If he dies, he dies\". Cheered on by spectators, I somehow mustered a 4:45/km kick, probably to the surprise of many, including myself.\n\nIt was only when I saw the finish line that I started believing that I was going to finish. Then something happened. My legs started wobbling like binary stars in a gravitational dance. Suddenly, my legs could no longer hold me,\ndeciding to stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in which I was just an innocent bystander. I fell right in front of the finish line with less than 1m left, then crawled across it. Highly dramatic finish for a 3h 49min 59s marathon. A friend who was in the crowd told me later on that I had had crossed the line with the fall, and the crawl wasn't necessary. But I like the cinematic version better, so I'm sticking to that in all future retelling of this race.\n\nI can't remember exactly what happened next. It felt like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale after getting tortured by Le Chiffre, hearing only whispers and seeing bright flashes of light. I remember waking up in one of those makeshift hospitals. I was giving water with sugar and got covered with a silver foil blanket and asked to rest for a while. I was let go two hours later after I was able to stand up by my own.\n\nThis is the story of my first marathon. On one hand, I missed my sub 3:30 dream, but I'm proud of my 3:49:59. Pushing through all those stop signs was reckless, yet I'm still happy I finished.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nIt would sound over-dramatic to say this, but I don't think marathons are for me. I don't enjoy runs beyond 20km. I feel I should just stick to blasting half marathons. I get so much joy running fast, not long.",

I started running in summer of 2021 and have taken it up as a serious hobby over the years. I ran my most recent half-marathon PR of 01:47 in October 2023 and had zero racing strategy for that one and just full-sent it the last 6 miles. I trained for my first marathon in summer of 2024 and ran 03:49:00 after a mostly-terrific training block where I was on target for 03:30:00 but had a total crash-out a month out (I had RED-S). Took off running from December-January 2025 due to shin splints + recovery but got back to it in February!\n\n# Training\n\nI didn't want to commit to a true training block for this race due to lingering uncertainties around my shin splints and because I was not mentally ready to lock in that much. I also really like lifting and wanted to keep it up 5x a week, which meant my running training wasn't as optimal as it could've been,  but I was happy. This was a typical week:\n\n| Day       | Workout                                              |\n|:----------|-----------------------------------------------------:|\n| Monday    | AM Lift + 4mi easy                                   |\n| Tuesday   | AM Lift + 4mi easy                                   |\n| Wednesday | 10\u201311mi with quality miles + PM Lift                 |\n| Thursday  | AM Lift + 4mi easy / elliptical                      |\n| Friday    | AM Lift + 4mi easy / 5\u20136mi tempo                     |\n| Saturday  | 14\u201316mi long run workout / easy if Friday tempo      |\n| Sunday    | 1 hr elliptical                                      |\n\nMy Wednesday runs were sometimes just steady + progression 5K at the end, or sometimes they were pyramid workouts, actual tempo runs in the middle, but whatever they were, they had some type of quality.\n\nMy LR workouts were my favorite. I didn't have a set structure to these either. All of them started with a mandatory 3mi WU and ended with a 1-2mi CD (as part of total mileage). They would often be 2mi@HM Pace repeats or 1mi@Bit Faster than HM Pace. Sometimes I would mix in HM Pace and Marathon pace, or 10K Pace for shorter intervals. Whatever the workout was, they were always intervals of some sort and I never did steady HM Pace for several miles. That wasn't intentional, but I guess it just wasn't what I was drawn to?\n\nThe flexibility of my 4x a week 4 mi easy runs was great. I never freaked out if I needed to change them to 45min ellipticals or if I had to shorten/skip them for whatever reason.\n\n# Pre-Race\n\nI took the bus to the neighboring town and then ran 1.5mi to the race start location as my warm-up shakeout. Unfortunately, I showed up 2 hours early, so I picked up my bib and then took a walk for an hour on the bike trail and tried to shake off some more anxiety. After milling around the parking lot another 20 minutes, I took off my sweatshirt and sweatpants and got ready to warm-up. I headed out for a 2mi warm-up, 1 mile slow and the other mile gradually speeding up and slowing down to my goal race effort. Things felt pretty normal. I still had more time to people watch after that haha. I lined up 10min from the scheduled start time and then I was off!\n\n# Race\n\nI envisioned being able to to give some detailed mile-by-mile breakdown when I wrote most of this report before my race, but alas, I was rather head-empty during the actual race.\n\nTrue to what other people had told me, this course was relatively flat. There was only one noticeable hill and besides that, just a lot of smaller ups and downs. I was told that there was a \u201cbeautiful downhill\u201d from Miles 11-12 by a friend and they must have remembered wrong because there was no such downhill.\u00a0Luckily, I was familiar with about 1/3 of the course as it was on familiar bike trails, so that gave me some comfort.\n\nI went into the race with the intention of racing by feel only. I ended up doing a mix of both, checking my watching about three times during the race to see if my perceived effort matched with my goal time.\u00a0\n\nOriginally, as a racing strategy, I had the following plan:\n\n- Miles 0-4: Head out at 8:15-8:30 (comfortable work pace)\n\n- Miles 4-9: Get a little quicker every mile down to 7:45\n\n- Miles 9-13.1: Push each mile more and go all out near the end ranging from 7:30-7:00\n\nAs my times show, I ended up racing pretty steady instead. That\u2019s not surprising considering that I am a consistent, steady runner and person in general. Not sure why I thought racing this race would be different haha, and it turned out not to be!\n\nAs I got to mile 4 and remembered my plan to pick up the pace, I checked in with myself about my RPE and decided to stay steady with the effort level I had and I\u2019m glad I did. That is why I am very glad I train largely by feel, so that I could adjust my plan during the race based on how my body was feeling.\u00a0\n\nThe race itself wasn\u2019t super big so the whole way, I was running by myself with maybe a person/two people in view running ahead. It was enough to have people to pass but not too many to feel super crowded. Not going to lie there was a 15 year old boy who was with me the first 10K and I was not about to be overtaken by him\ud83d\ude02  I passed him at mile 7 and never looked back.\u00a0\n\nAnother thing that kept me going was \u201cShe\u2019s flyin\u2019!\u201d that was uttered by one of the volunteers as I passed by the aid station at mile 9.\n\nI was not feeling fabulous in the last 5K but I knew from race videos of pros that I had watched that that was okay and I should still be able to hold out, so I didn't freak out. It helped being able to know how to feel at different parts of the race so I knew I wasn't pushing too hard/too little. I looked down at my watch after I passed the 12.5 mile marker to see if I had made it under 1:45 and when I saw 1:36:xx I freaked out with joy and that was the last push I needed to get over the finish.\n\n# Post-Race\n\nSo proud of this result! This was my first race where I went in with the intention of being serious about pushing my pace and giving it my all. I knew I could get the sub-1:45 if I didn't give up, as I had gotten a 1:44 on my flat training run a couple weeks before. And I was shocked that I rolled in under 1:40, too! This training block was DEFINITELY not everything I envisioned (had to juggle illness, school and job-interviewing stress) but I got my workouts in and I did it! After my marathon debacle, I felt like I lost confidence in my ability to run fast, but this block and race showed me that I still have it and I WILL achieve a goal so long as I tell myself I will. It was also great to see that I don't have to be on some big official plan to reach my goals and I can make running work for me. Now....onto my sub-22:00 5K in a couple weeks! Not as attached to that goal as this was my big one, but it'd be another thing off my list!",

    "selftext": "Today is day 100 of running 1 mile or more every day.\n\nI am gathering a few thoughts from the past 100 days and hopefully they help someone else who is new to running. \n\nFor context I am new to running. I\u2019ve been running a little over a year. As part of my weight loss journey I made a journal entry in October of 2023, the goal: run one mile without stopping. Today I have run over 225 miles this year and completed two half marathons. Somehow I went from hating running to it being my passion. \n\nThis was not my New Year\u2019s resolution or anything and honestly I accidentally fell into it. At the end of last year I purchased 2 pairs of running shoes and wanted to decide which was the right fit for me, I kept running a mile in one and then a mile the next day in the other. My goal was to run in each one enough to decide which to keep and which to sell (You know where this is going.. I have both pairs still.) I got about 2 weeks in and decided I would only keep it up if I didn\u2019t get injured. I am happy to report that I am injury free! \n\nInjury prevention:\n\nAs many do, I went too hard the first few months when I started running and was injured a lot of 2024. I had a ton of feet problems, runners knee Achilles tendinitis and hip flexor issues. I spent way too much money on acupuncture, orthotics, PT, braces, pt equipment, massage guns and had whiplashes of running hard one month then being unable to run the next month. I only ran 1 mile in November due to peroneal tendinitis and physical therapy.  So how did I go from barely being able to run one time in November to running every day this year? If you sign up for my\u2026 just kidding. Being careful and building strength in my legs and feet. Strength training is easy to forego but leg days helped to give me a solid foundation to work from, specifically helped remove any knee pain. PT exercises for my feet, calves and glutes have helped tremendously as well. Most bang for your buck, toe yoga, calf raises, squats and glute bridges. A PT is going to yell at me for not including RDLs, so add those if you want. In addition to the basics for strength and conditioning one of best things I\u2019ve found is to A. Get fitted for the right shoes and B. Use a rotation. Most runners will tell you a solid rotation consists of a daily trainer, a speed day shoe, a max cushion/recovery shoe and a race day shoe. My rotation has been focused on strengthening and protecting my legs while pushing mileage. I have focused on varying drops as well as different stack heights. This has helped strengthen different muscles in my feet and legs.. personally I fall back on high drop and stack when I\u2019m sore and go very slow. \n\nKnowing I am going to run again the next day has helped me to not push myself to hard. I\u2019ve been able to slow down and make so much more progress by being careful.\n\nThis has been a blast but has had plenty of challenges. First being time. Finding time to run every day means running in the rain, running at midnight, running in the snow, running on lunch breaks\u2026 time on a run takes time from the family.  My wife has had it way harder than I have. One of the biggest challenges I faced was running while sick. I\u2019ve only run on a treadmill twice, and that was while I was traveling for a funeral while also sick. The week I was sick I did every run super slow and didn\u2019t go over a mile. I\u2019m not suggesting this but I was too deep into the streak to not at least try. Another challenge has been running while sore, obviously right? All of February I would wake up with my calves completely locked up and sore. I was shocked how bad they got.. pushing through that month was worth it, my legs adjusted and I only feel sore now after a long run or big workout. But for a while there I thought it was going to be that bad every day.\n\nFinal thoughts, I really hope this encourages someone else to get out and get some miles in. Would I suggest running everyday? No, it\u2019s probably not the best idea medically but everyone is different. For me, running every day has been the most fun challenge, and has helped to prevent more injury. The steak continues tomorrow!",

    "selftext": "I've used the 955, 255, 945, and even recently tried Coros \u2014 but I keep coming back to my old 735XT. Why? Because it's the only watch that truly nailed what matters.\n\nThe 945 came close on weight, battery, and features. Coros has a slick UI but wildly inflated battery claims. Yet the 735XT\u2019s no-nonsense simplicity and reliability still stand out:\n\n* Slim, lightweight, genuinely comfortable\n* Reliable GPS and multisport tracking\n* Native power and sensor support\n* No bulky wrist HR bump or AMOLED gimmicks\n* Just enough features \u2014 no bloat\n* Solid battery (but ready for a modern upgrade)\n* No music, no pay, no AMOLED, no faux recovery metrics\n* No overhyped multiband GPS that wrecks battery life  \n\nWhat we really need is a **735XT+**:\n\n* More accurate GPS and long multi-day battery (\\~30\u201340+ hrs)\n* Native power, sensor, and zone graph support\n* Accurate training effect/load via external HRM\n* Simple real-world metrics like endurance/hill score \u2014 *done well*\n* Breadcrumb nav & route elevation profile \u2014 *minimum is enough*\n* No titanium bezel pretending we\u2019re Navy SEALs  \n\nLet\u2019s be real \u2014 most of us don\u2019t smash our wrists on rocks. Few need a \u00a3600+ metal-encased smart-brick with flashlight mode and pulse ox in five colours.\n\nGarmin\u2019s great at adding \u2014 and restricting \u2014 features across more confusingly overlapping models than anyone needs. Feature bloat, wrist irritation, and increasingly unreliable wrist HR come up again and again online. What we need is a return to focused, reliable endurance tools.\n\nThe 735XT was everything a performance watch needed (for its time): slim, light, durable. No fluff, no skin burn, no wellness metrics that cause more stress than they solve. Just the right tools, the right data, and the freedom to train hard and go long.\n\nGive us that again \u2014 with a modern twist, better battery, and tighter GPS \u2014 and it might just be the most perfect endurance watch on the market.\n\nHRV and stress metrics might help sell watches, but they don\u2019t work for everyone. Some of us want less noise, not more. We want to be empowered by data not ruled by it. Garmin should offer a stripped-back but *powerful* training tool \u2014 not every athlete needs a wellness dashboard.\u00a0\n\nWe want full access to core performance features like structured workouts, power support, navigation, and real world metrics \u2014 without the distraction of recovery voodoo or daily readiness scores.\n\nThe Forerunner 55 is too limited. The 955 is overloaded. Even the 255 \u2014 probably the closest \u2014 still falls short. It\u2019s bulkier, less intuitive, and saddled with a flaky HR sensor that opens up sleep stages and HRV tracking most of us don\u2019t genuinely need \u2014 and certainly can\u2019t trust. Let\u2019s not lose the tools that work, in pursuit of features we\u2019ve been convinced we need.\n\nSome of us want to train hard and recover smart \u2014 but guided by feel, not fear. We want a watch that *supports* intuition, not replaces it. A durable, trusted workhorse that strips back the fluff but keeps the power. **This is why the 735XT+ will sell.**\n\nI would buy it in a heartbeat.\n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\n",

Thanks in advance for any advice or tips on the best way to do this \n\nEdit: Thanks everyone who responded for providing your advice. I ended up focusing on getting better sleep for the week leading up to the run and moved going to bed about an hour earlier but nothing too drastic.

    "selftext": "Hello everyone! \n\nI (28f) am currently training for my second half in mid May \u2014 not doing anything crazy, I\u2019m not a fast runner or training super intensely.\n\n I recently switched from Hoka Arahis to Saucony Guides and I think what\u2019s happened is that my feet aren\u2019t used to the thick thick soles and I\u2019ve had two falls in the first month of the Sauconys due to clipping the pavement. The first one was okay, I got back up and ran the remaining 12kms of my 18th run. The second wasn\u2019t quite so easy to come back from \u2014 I tripped 5.5km into my usual weekday 7km, and smacked my face off the pavement so hard I needed stitches at A&E. Mercifully the damage was all superficial and apart from a nasty facial cut that\u2019s gonna leave a bit of a scar, I know it was lucky I wasn\u2019t concussed or worse.\n\nI haven\u2019t been for a run this week, mostly because the shifting of my weight tugs the stitches, and my knees are pretty grazed and bruised up. But now that I\u2019m just about healed up, I know I need to think about getting back out there over the next couple of days, but I keep having flashbacks to the moment my face hit the kerb. I know what I have to do to make my runs safer (lift my feet a bit higher for one) but I\u2019m struggling to get past the nerves and anxiety. Has anyone else been through anything similar? Any advice? I love running so I don\u2019t want it tainted with anxiety. ",

    "selftext": "Hello ! I've been running 4 times a week for the past six weeks coming back from a 6 months break (not due to injury). I've started slow (15-25 minutes runs) and 90% zone 1-2 and I'm now at four 45-55 minutes runs a week. Following a 80/20 intensity repartition. \n\nI decided to implement some cross training in my week that would be either cycling, elliptical, stair climbing or uphill walking to do more physical activity without running more and risking injury. At first I was thinking 4 runs and 1 cross training session or 3 runs and 2 cross training sessions.\n\nBut after doing an easy 40 minutes cycling session (easy being my cycling Zone 1 and 2), I feel like I'd like to do maybe 3-4 cross training sessions per week. Would it be okay ? Or would it lead to injury ?\nIf I'm able to do 3 or 4 sessions, should all of them be easy sessions or can I push a bit on one or two without increasing the risk of injury?\n\nThank you in advance and have a great day !\n\nPS : I'm doing the 75Hard program that asks two 45' workouts per day. For the past 30 days I've mainly been running and walking with 3 strength sessions scattered around the month. But with 4 running sessions per week, most of my workouts have been walks and I've been wanting to increase the \"level\" of physical activity for now because I feel like I can and want to do a bit more.\nJust explaining this here if it helps with context",

Even abysmally slow running feels like I'm being choked and can never catch my breath, I never hit my stride, or get the familiar runners high. My base run pace has dropped in excess of 4 minutes a mile each. Leaving Korea I could easily hold an 8 minute pace basically indefinitely and now just keeping myself moving, at ANY pace, for 30 minutes is an incredible mental battle. \n\nI don't know how I'm supposed to train, I've kept myself somewhat together by doing HIIT since I can mentally get through very short bursts of high activity.

    "title": "USA Women's Half Marathon-Nashville (2025) Review",
    "selftext": "Hello all. I just ran the USA Women's Half Marathon in Nashville on April 5, 2025 and wanted to leave an honest review since the leadership is deleting comments on their social media posts. It seems like this organization is known for their poor logistics and courses but I'm going to lay out what happened this past weekend and why it's not ok for it to cost almost $200. It's also a USATF Certified course- that distinction needs to be rescinded.\n\n1. **Poor/no communication:** Some people received updates via text, some via email, some not at all. I personally received emails that were about the hotel accommodations and very few about the race updates.\n2. **Updates that were not shared via email, only on social media (if at all): Advertised VS. Actual**\n   * Course time limit: 6 hours VS. 3.5 hours\n   * Premiums: Lululemon Shirt and Kendra Scott necklace VS. unknown/generic brand shirt and necklace (in place of the Lululemon shirt, racers received a tee shirt and a long sleeve). The women's shirt was a boat neck that quite a few people seemed to dislike.\n   * Leadership changes\n   * Start time: 7am VS. 6:30am\n3. **The Expo:** this was a very underwhelming and disappointing expo. There were only a couple vendors and one tent that had merch. If this was such a big race as advertised, why would you not have more vendors or tables with nutrition that runners could purchase?\n4. **Start Line was unorganized and lack luster:** Upon arrival, cones and barriers were still not set up. There was no MC or music, just a start line inflatable. There were no announcements or lead-up, just the national anthem a few minutes before start and then we started the race. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a big deal, but it was advertised as this big event to celebrate women. You'd think that they would have mentioned at least the mission statement of the organization or called attention to the \"women's\" aspect of the race. The volunteers guiding people were a little cranky, too. It seemed thrown together and last minute.\n5. **Poor safety for runners:** Upon arrival, barriers were lying on the ground and crews came out after the race started to set up cones. This posed a safety threat to runners. Cars were confused about where the runners should be and the course had limited volunteers to help guide. There also need to be more cones. Volunteers were stopping runners to let cars go which should NEVER happen during a race unless there is an emergency.\n6. **The course:** This was the worst half marathon course I have personally ever run. The section on the trail was fine, but the rest was in parking lots. The parking lots at the end didn't even have cones set out and we were just expected to \"run the perimeter\"- how is that going to get close to a 13.1 mile distance? That being said, the course was under 13.1 miles. This is a national marathon and USATF-certified, did no one bike the course to make sure it was the correct distance? At one point, runners were expected to share a 4-foot wide sidewalk, going in two directions, that had trees encroaching on it. There weren't even any crowds.\n7. **The course (again):** I wanted to break this out because it has to do with the directions and lack of signage. There were so many turn-arounds in the course and at one point, you have to turn left at a location where the is a sign pointing to go right. Only because a volunteer eventually made it out to the cross over point, did runners know to go left but there was an instance of two runners who cut the course (on accident), only ran 12 miles, and made podium. That's unfair and not to USATF regulations. Plus, who crosses runners over each other so many times?\n8. **The finish line:** The finish line was lack luster. I won't comment on this too much since it was pouring rain.\n\nI'm sure there are other things that I'm missing, but I wanted to highlight things to make clear that this race is a scam. I have run over a dozen half marathons and have not had such a bad experience for so much money. If this race had cost $50, I would not have minded as much but it's a scam. It's advertised as luxury and pampering and none of that happened. My local half marathons are more \"Luxurious\" than this one. There was not much transparency in the changes and who knows what happened with the leadership but there were a lot of missteps.\n\nThis should have been a celebration of women running together and uplifting one another.\n\nIf you ran this half and had a good time, I'm so happy for you! But please believe me when I say there are so many other good half marathons you can run that cost less, are more fun, and are on better courses. Please do not run any other USA Women's Half Marathons- save your money!\n\nEdited for spelling errors.",

It\u2019s almost quaint, [reading that race report again](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/12dmtve/berlin_half_marathon_the_best_two_hour_therapy/), but the short version is: I had no idea what I was doing, ran a 1:55 without any proper training or a gps watch, but it was quite emotional to run that race and afterwards I got seriously bit by the running bug. This year, like last, my sister in law T brought along her kids and some more family members to run and cheer for us in Berlin. \n\nThroughout last year I had some really lofty goals and I failed miserably at all of them; even though they were PBs I was a bit disappointed with two half marathons at 1:34:XX and Stockholm Marathon at 3:34. All three of those races were quite hot (over 20\u00b0C at the start), and I simply wasn\u2019t prepared to run in those conditions, but it still felt a bit shitty to fail in the same way all three races; keep perfect goal pace (4:15 and 4:40, respectively) for the the first half of the races then bonk completely in the second halves. \n\nSo my goal at Berlin this year was simply to run a negative split. Not bonk. People who know I care about running asked me what time I was aiming for, but I didn\u2019t want to say a number. My Garmin race predictor has lied to me before, so I just said I wanted to run a negative split. I\u2019m in the middle of a Pfitz 18/55 marathon plan for Stockholm Marathon in late may, and I\u2019ve felt really good on my long runs, but still; the goal here was just to execute the race well, and do the second half slightly faster than the first half. I just wanted to run a race properly, for once.\n\n### Pre-race\nI combined the trip to Berlin with a visit to some friends who live in Prague. My wife and one year old daughter got to spend four fantastic days walking up and down the hilly cobblestones of Prague: not an ideal lead up to a street race, but what the hell\u2026 I don\u2019t know how many more trips like this I\u2019ll be able to do. We took the train to Berlin on Saturday morning, a bit ironic as the Prague HM was that same day. \n\nOn race day I was surprisingly calm. My daughter slept through the night and I got a solid 8 hours. Weather report had really been on my side here; unlike the 23\u00b0C of 2024, the the forecast for our race was 4-8\u00b0C partly cloudy. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear and my family seemed shocked when I was getting dressed in my singlet; but in the end I was happy that\u2019s what I chose. It\u2019s also the only pink thing I have to run in, for my brother.\n\nIn the starting corrals I saw people dressed for what looked like arctic expeditions; scarves, long sleeves, long running tights\u2026. Maybe us Swedes are more used to cold running but I always run in shorts if it\u2019s above 0\u00b0. My current fitness should probably have me in corral A, but my PBs had me placed in corral B, which I\u2019m actually quite happy about; I got to the corral early and made sure I was at the front of my group. For the first time since I started running, I wasn\u2019t nervous at all at the starting line. This was going to be FUN.\n\n### Race\nBeing at the front of corral B was perfect because it kept me from going out too fast. It seemed like people around me were maybe rushing a bit, some were breathing quite heavily early on but I was super comfortable at around a 4:10 pace. Now\u2026 I know I said I didn\u2019t have a time goal, but since I was treating the whole thing as training for the full marathon coming up, I had set up my watch for a 1:27 pace. The idea was to do the first 10k at around 4:10 and the second half around 4:05. This was conservative in relation to my Garmin race predictor (but like I said, it\u2019s always been optimistic for me before). \n\nAfter leaving Tiergarten, the first 5k or so were pretty crowded and on relatively narrow streets. I ticked a couple of Ks above my target pace but kept my cool. I thought to myself, and even said out loud: \u201dthis is fine\u2026. I have 15k left to make up those few seconds, and it will make it even easier to make my negative splits. I had decided before the race to feel out my need for drinks, and at the first station there was a huge rush to grab a cup: I saw it from far ahead and decided it wasn\u2019t worth it to go into that mess and skipped it. I wasn\u2019t thirsty and it wasn\u2019t hot, I would be fine without. \n\nAt around 6K the course deviated a bit from previous years, and we just had a long, amazing stretch of slightly downhill, very wide Kurfurstendamm for about 3 kms before we hit Kaiser Wilhelm Church where I knew my family was set up to cheer for us. This part of the race was such a high point for me. I wasn\u2019t even close to getting tired, my legs were feeling great and I was *holding back* at around 4:00 pace. I got a little energy boost after my family all cheered for me around 9k and then had a bit of a shock when I clocked the 10k split faster than my 10k PB (41:20 from another disappointing race last year). I had a half a cup of water here for the hell of it. I don\u2019t think it was needed but it was there and there was no rush of people around me so I don\u2019t think I lost more than a handful of seconds doing it.\n\nAfter that I got a little bit worried that it was going to happen again, that the first half had felt so amazing and the inevitable bonk was coming. But instead of panicking I just calmed down, took stock of how I felt and came to the conclusion that it was still going according to plan, if slightly fast. Around Potsdamer Platz it got quite windy and some gusts felt like they came head on, but I knew from previous years that it would get better in Mitte, and kept my cool. For the last bit of the race, the course was quite different than last year, when we had done a bunch of zig zag for a bit through central Berlin; this year we had a 4 km out and back on a wide street\u2026 some runners I talked to hated this part but I kind of loved it. Yeah, it got quite windy there again and it was a bit confusing because it felt like it just kept going, but I also get really inspired seeing really fast runners (almost elite) in the same race as I\u2019m running. If I had been in corral A I probably would\u2019ve met the front pack here. \n\nAfter that section and a little twist around Alexanderplatz, we got to Unter Den Linden and the finish line was in sight, but with 2 km left to go. I didn\u2019t want to look at my watch, so I just reminded myself of what the last 2 km on my way home on a regular tempo day feels like, how silly short it is, and decided to kick it. It wasn\u2019t a sprint, it wasn\u2019t even *that* much faster than the rest of the race, but it just felt **so good** to have a little speed left in the tank. I did the last 2,1k at about 3:55 pace and those last 100 meters after Brandenburger Tor were just pure joy. I don\u2019t know if I cried but I certainly laughed as I crossed the finish line well under my Garmin pace, and with a slightly negative split. \n\n\n### Post-race and reflections\nI don\u2019t know what to say here. After four really disappointing races last year I finally managed to perform, execute, whatever you want to call it, the way that I had set out to. I know this comes with experience, and I certainly have more now than I did last year. But I also have to remember this feeling going into my A race in seven weeks. \n\nI think that what I\u2019m most proud of in this race was just the way that I kept my cool in the little wrinkles that came my way. I saw some of my splits be a little slow, and decided that was fine. Later on I noticed I was going too fast and still decided that I was feeling strong. I think I also realized that what works for me is to say my thoughts out loud. It made them more concrete somehow, rather than just something I was thinking about. \n\n\u2014\n\nI remember one time when my brother had managed one of his big goals in running; a sub 2:48 marathon (4:00/k pace), after many many attempts. This was way before I started running so I didn't really *get* it, but I just remember how he was just so happy that whole day, and for weeks after. I think this was the first time I felt that way after a run. I really enjoy running but the high of executing a race the way you wanted is new for me. And I haven\u2019t been this happy at a finish line since that first half marathon, two years ago, which was very emotional in a different way. It makes me sad, of course, that I won\u2019t share that feeling with him, but it meant so much to share it with his (and my) family; everyone was super happy with their results, almost everyone had a new PB, and I think most impressive was his daughter, aged 17, who lowered her PB by 15 minutes. \n\nIt seems that Berlin HM will be a lottery race starting next year, so I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to race it as a family again. But we have our sights set for something else next year\u2026. It seems like Prague is quite likely. I can\u2019t wait. \n\nBut before then\u2026\u2026 Stockholm Marathon in 7 weeks. I'll have to temper my hubris.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "This year London Marathon has a new Green Team for runners choose not to have kitbag drop. Green uses blue start line.\n\nWith a 2:45 estimated finish time, I have been assigned to Green Wave 1. However, the start time is 9:52-9:54, which is almost 20min late than other wave 1 starts. This means if you are fast runners in Green then 100% you will have to run with runner at much slower pace then you.\n\nAs I did my research, Blue, Pink, Yellow wave 1 all start at 9:35-9:39. \nGreen wave 2 start at ~10:17, almost the same time as Blue wave 10.\n\nWhat London Marathon organizers did was to put sub 3 runners behind 3:00-3:30 groups in such a bit event. This not only creates safety issues but also punish people who chose to go green. \n\nNote: they did also promise that choosing Green wont impact start time. Apparently NOT true! \n\nMaybe the organizers just dont care because the fast runners in Green is only a small group, they care more about marketing. They even came up with a separate participant guide for Team Green. The content of which is mostly the same as the regular participant guid\u2026.  \n\nCOMPLETE wave start time and pacer information are posted here:\n[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/s/fs79V0KJ0m)\n\nUpdate: London Marathon organizers have just sent out updated start time to affected Team Green runners",

    "title": "Diablo 50K (April 5, 2025) - My First Long Trail Run, Race Recap",
    "selftext": "**Before the Race**\n\nHaving done numerous half marathons over the years - both road and trail - I started to lose interest in the road ones. Trails were different. The scenery changed, the climbs made you earn the views, and the people felt like my kind of people: offbeat, friendly, quick to chat on the uphills, supportive without making a big deal of it. Trail runners, in their quiet weirdness, made the miles go by easier.\n\nEach year, I trained hard through the late spring, summer, and fall. But once winter hit, I always backed off -January to April became my off-season. And for the last three years, like clockwork, I would see races pop up in March and April that I wanted to do. Races that sparked something. But I'd always say, 'Next year.'\n\nBecause I wasn't in race shape. Because I hadn't trained enough. Because work was busy. Always a reason.\n\nThis year was no different - at least, at first. I'd been logging 8 to 12 treadmill miles a week, just enough to stay lightly active but nowhere near race-ready. Then, about three weeks before race day, I saw it again: the Diablo Trails Challenge 50K. The race I always wanted to do. The one I always told myself I'd be ready for 'next year.' Despite best intentions, life (and work) didn't give me space for a structured training block. Still, I kept wondering: Could I do this anyway? Even untrained? Just to see what I had in me?\n\nAs race day got closer, my thoughts bounced between:\n\n\\- I really want to do this.\n\n\\- I've passed on it for years - what if next year I have a kid, get injured, get sick? There might never be a perfect time.\n\n\\- But I'm dead after a 30K when I'm trained. How can I possibly finish a 50K like this?\n\n\\- What if I get hurt? What if I have to pull out mid-race? What if I wreck myself and can't work next week?\n\nThat back-and-forth continued right up until the night before. Finally, after some intense internal dialogue and a whole lot of pacing in my kitchen, I signed up. I figured if I finished, great. If I didn't, I'd at least find out where my limit was. But I didn't want to spend another year watching this race pass by and wondering what if.\n\n**Race Morning**\n\nAfter a last-minute dash to stock up on electrolytes and trail snacks, check my gear, and hunt down clean running clothes, I received one final curveball: an email from the race organizers. 'Expect to run through 12 creeks in the first 3 miles,' it said. Great. Nothing like a surprise foot soak to kick off the day.\n\nI barely slept the night before. My brain was on a loop: Am I making a huge mistake? Will I even make it back home tonight? What if I fall and get hurt? What if I emotionally wreck myself by dropping out early? I'd never even run a flat marathon. And here I was, about to attempt a 50K with massive elevation.\n\nI decided to lean fully into ignorance. Just get to the start line, stand at the back, and go. That was the whole plan. No expectations. No pressure.\n\nRemember the game plan, I told myself:\n\n\\- Start slow - slower than slow.\n\n\\- Don't get pulled into half marathon mode.\n\n\\- Don't let the start-line energy trick you into chasing people.\n\n\\- You're not racing anyone. You're here to finish.\n\nThe gun went off. Everyone took off down the trail, charging ahead. I started running... and found myself dead last. Perfect.\n\n**The First 10 Miles**\n\nThe first 10 miles were surprisingly okay. I'd run these trails before during the half marathon, so I knew what was coming - at least in theory. I kept my heart rate under 150, walked the uphills like I promised myself I would, and made sure to take in plenty of fluids. Around mile 3, I started snacking - nothing fancy, just easing my stomach into the routine.\n\nEverything still felt under control. My heart rate was steady, the slow pace was working, and the snacks were going down well. I started to think: This might be okay. Maybe I can actually do this. Maybe all this talk about undertraining was just noise. The gear, the food, the heart rate - it was all working.\n\nPoor fool. I had no idea what was coming.\n\n**Miles 10-13: The Slide into Curry Canyon**\n\nAround mile 10, the course veered off the main trail onto an out-and-back stretch down Curry Canyon Road. I'd seen this turn on the map beforehand and didn't give it much thought. The view of Mt. Diablo loomed ahead - the main assault on that monster was coming soon, and I felt strangely confident.\n\nAs I made the turn onto the Curry Canyon spur, I passed a steady stream of runners emerging from it, and thought, Okay, I'm not that far behind everyone. I'm still in the mix.\n\nThen the downhill started. Steep. Long. And it kept going. And going. And going. 1.5 miles of downhill, one direction - and somewhere around the halfway point, the creeping realization hit: I have to climb all the way back up this before I even start climbing Diablo.\n\nA knot formed in my chest. I was in the shit now.\n\nThis was the first moment when my spirit really began to waver. The sun was out now and starting to cook the trail, the shade becoming patchy and unreliable. I tried to play music - a playlist I'd made just for this moment - hoping to lift my mood and distract myself from the climb. But like always, music jacked my heart rate up 15-20 BPM. I couldn't afford that kind of spike. I ditched the plan and climbed in silence.\n\nWhen I finally emerged from Curry Canyon and rejoined the main trail, I felt... nervous. Half a mile later, I passed the turnoff point for the half marathon - a turn I knew well from past races. I glanced down at my Garmin. 13 miles done. A half marathon. And yet I hadn't even begun the true climb.\n\nMt. Diablo still lay ahead, and with it, 19 more miles and thousands of feet of climbing.\n\nI stood there in the heat, legs already aching, and thought: Can I really continue? My own ego, my own hubris, has landed me here... and now the climb begins.\n\n**The Climb to the Summit**\n\nAt the aid station, I refilled my hydration pack, dumped in the last of my electrolytes, and inhaled a Clif bar.\n\nTime to fill the tank - I knew what was ahead. Having fueled up, I felt a bit better. Regained my composure. This is no time to give into doubt and fear, my man, I told myself.\n\nI'd done this climb before. I knew what was coming.\n\nAs I started moving again, I pulled out a peanut butter pouch - thinking it'd be a nice protein hit. Big mistake. It was like inhaling dry insulation or powdered glue. The label said \"dry roasted peanut butter with palm oil\" and it lived up to every word. It took three huge gulps of water just to choke down the first bite. Rookie mistake.\n\nThe climb was long. Grinding. But... not as bad as I feared. I think those hours on the stairmaster actually paid off. I kept it slow and steady, heart rate low, and focused on the views: green hills, wildflowers, the sweep of the East Bay softened by spring. I reminded myself how lucky I was to be out here at all - uninjured, healthy, and able to attempt something like this.\n\nIt was hot, but not scorching. The miles ticked by, and somehow, I arrived - weary but in good spirits - at the summit aid station. A volunteer gave me an ice-water sponge bath over my head and shoulders, and it was glorious.\n\nMy legs were tired, but not wrecked. The worst is over, I thought. Maybe I can actually do this.\n\nOne of the volunteers smiled and said, \"You've made it up - now you just need to go down.\" And I thought: He's right. I made it up here. I can make it down. Yes!\n\nThe real hell was about to start.\n\nIf I knew what was coming, I never would have signed up for this.\n\n**North Peak - The Breaking Point**\n\nFrom the summit of Mt. Diablo, the trail dropped into a long, 3-mile downhill stretch. The breeze cooled me down, the path was runnable, and for the first time all day, I truly believed everything is going to be okay.\n\nSure, I still had 13 miles to go - a full half marathon - but it was mostly downhill or flat. I told myself I could hike the descents, jog the flats, and cruise into the finish. A quiet confidence settled in.\n\nThat all ended - fast.\n\nThe climb to North Peak is only 0.7 miles. But the final section is a soul-crushing, spirit-destroying monster - a 16% grade trail covered in loose rock, gravel, and what might as well be marbles.\n\nAs I started the climb, my legs were already shredded. Every step felt like I was dragging dead weight uphill. I was stunned that the course would include something this steep, this poorly maintained, this late in the race.\n\nGoing up the trail, I saw another runner inching downward, sitting on the ground, using her hands and feet to brace herself. She was stuck - too afraid to move.\n\nAnother woman passed me in tears, trying to keep moving but barely holding it together. And that's when the anger set in.\n\nI questioned everything. Why would they put this in the race? If I'm going to get hurt, it'll be here. I can't break bones - I have work on Monday. What are they thinking?\n\nMy mind screamed: \"This risk isn't worth it. This is just some dumb Saturday race - turn around. Go no further.\"\n\nI stood there, exhausted, furious, watching the trail get steeper ahead. For the first time, I genuinely wondered if I should quit.\n\n**The Mind Split**\n\nAt a certain point in races like this, I know I can't trust my mind. My rational, risk-averse subconscious - the version of me that keeps me safe in everyday life - starts to creep in and take over.\n\nThe longer a run drags on, the harder it becomes, the more it turns into a battle between two voices:\n\n\\- The ambitious one - the version of me that signed up, full of hope and excitement, asking \"What if?\"\n\n\\- And the other one - the safety-first, back-out-now voice that just wants this to end.\n\nBy the time I was partway up North Peak, that battle was at 50/50. Fear and exhaustion were gaining the upper hand.\n\nFor a moment, a thought crossed my mind: If I turn around right now... would anyone even know? There's probably no one up top checking. I could just turn around. Keep running. Say I made it. Get my finish.\n\nI indulged it, briefly. But then another voice shot through: Is that who I am? Is that how I want to remember this race? A cheat? A fraud?\n\nThat would be far worse than not finishing.\n\nThat realization made me furious - at myself, for even thinking it. And with that fire, I kept climbing. Fueled by anger now, not fear.\n\nWhen I finally reached the top, my legs were screaming. My back throbbed. My sunburn was flaring to life and stinging badly.\n\nAnd there it was - a roll of stickers, left by the race organizers to prove you'd made it. I peeled one off and stuck it proudly to my bib. Yes. I was here. I made it.\n\nGoing down, I remembered a trick that I had read in some old SAS outdoor survival book which I read 20 years ago: Never look at the whole slope. Just focus on your next two or three steps.\n\nSo that's what I did - picking out solid rocks as anchor points, ignoring the loose gravel ocean around me.\n\nOne careful step after another, eyes low, moving through the fear. Eventually, I reached the bottom. I was back on the trail. The worst was over. Surely, I thought, it's gotta be smooth sailing from here to the finish.\n\n**Miles 20-23: The Grind to Juniper**\n\nThe run to the Juniper aid station was only about 4 miles, but it felt like double that. The trail narrowed into rocky, technical singletrack. It was slow going - picking through stones, taking large, uneven steps up and down, carefully moving around clusters of day hikers.\n\nAt this point, I was longing for the wide-open, gently sloping curves of the foothills. I just wanted space. Predictable terrain. Something soft underfoot.\n\nInstead, I got bees.\n\nOut of nowhere, I stumbled into a hive. A few of them followed me for five minutes as I trotted away - thankfully, they weren't aggressive. But I was rattled.\n\nThe real scare came just after that. The singletrack ended abruptly at a fire road, where the trail made a hard left. In front of me - directly in front - was a sheer drop-off into a canyon. My legs hesitated, slow to respond. I stood there staring down into the void, unable to stop completely, feeling gravity pull me forward. Thankfully, they responded in time. I veered left. Still on my feet.\n\nAnd just like that - I was back on a wide road again. It felt like bliss.\n\nBut the final stretch to Juniper dragged on. The terrain wasn't too hard, but my legs were wrecked. Even on flats, I couldn't push past a 16-minute mile. Everything hurt. Every step was a test of patience.\n\nWhen I finally arrived at the Juniper aid station, at mile 23, I seriously considered calling it. I could call my wife. Get picked up. Be in an air-conditioned car in 20 minutes. End this now. This was my mental low point.\n\nBut instead of quitting, I walked over and refilled my fluids. A volunteer handed me an ice-cold sponge and doused my head and shoulders. The water hit like magic - an electric jolt of relief. For a moment, I felt human again.\n\nJust four more miles to the next aid station. I could do that.\n\n**Miles 23-32: The Long Road Home**\n\nIt was somewhere on Burma Road that I passed the 26-mile mark and realized: I'd just completed  a marathon. Technically, my first.\n\nAbout 10% of my mind took a flicker of pride in that. A marathon, without much - or any - real training, and on hills like these? That's something.\n\nBut the other 90% of me didn't care at all. Because the task at hand was far from over.\n\nI had long since run out of food. My electrolytes were gone. Each sip of water felt like it was diluting whatever salt I had left in my system. My legs were pounded to pulp, and the sunburn made the straps of my hydration vest feel like sandpaper. I could feel the blisters blooming on both big toes - I tried to ignore them.\n\nMy legs cramped up regularly now, seizing without warning. I had two salt tabs left and was saving them like lifeboats for the next serious climb. No matter how much water I drank, I still felt dry. I started to worry - Am I doing damage? Are my kidneys okay? Did I overdo the electrolytes earlier?\n\nThe views were astonishing - majestic green hills, storybook trails weaving into the horizon. At one point, I stumbled upon a small pond in the middle of nowhere, inexplicably full of goldfish. It was beautiful. It was surreal. I wished I could appreciate it more than I did.\n\nAt the final aid station, I picked up a packet of applesauce. It was, hands down, the best thing I had ever eaten in my life.\n\nThe last 4 miles retraced the trail we'd taken earlier in the day. I knew what was coming. I knew I could do it. But I also wondered when - or if - my body might just give out. The same trails I'd climbed easily that morning now looked enormous. Every step down jarred my legs. I clung to trees, to rocks, to the trail itself when I had to take a big step. Cramping flared at the slightest shift in terrain.\n\nBut then... the final two miles. Mostly flat. Rolling. Manageable. I started to believe, really believe, that I would finish.\n\nHalf a mile from the line, I walked - just to buy myself enough in the tank to 'run' the last stretch.\n\nAnd then I saw them - my wife, the race organizer, a few strangers cheering from the finish. And in that moment, I snapped back. I actually did this. I'm not injured. I'm here. I finished.\n\nIt didn't feel triumphant. It felt peaceful. Real. Grounded in the kind of pride that no medal can give you - the kind you earn one broken step at a time.\n\nAnd none of it would've been possible without my wife - for encouraging me to sign up, for believing I could do it when I wasn't sure myself, for being there at the end. I never would've finished without her love and support.\n\nMy final time was a little over 9 hours, a number that means everything and nothing all at once. It wasn't about speed, it was about getting through it. And I did.",

    "title": "House v. NCAA is terrible for the sport",
    "selftext": "In the recent House v. NCAA, it aims to limit roster spots on XC teams to 17 and Track & Field teams to 45. Although every athlete may now be scholarshipped, is it really what is good for the sport?\n\nFirst of all, it ruins walk-ons. Like no more walk-ons. Many rosters will fill their spots to 17. It doesn't allow for high schoolers who are seeking to run at a higher level than D3 and hope to improve. Personally, I am a junior who runs a 9:40 3200m and hope to lower it to around 9:20 by the time I leave. These times are not close to level needed to get recruited to run D1, and I am okay with that. But, I still want to try to run at a D1 level and improve towards a better time and maybe be able to make a top spot my senior year of college, but I won't even have the chance to do so. I worry that because this limits the ability to have larger rosters, many teams will need to just take runners they already know are great: Kenyans. It is obvious that a majority of Kenyans are better than high school runners, but are these rosters really going to be filled with foreigners because our own damn country is too worried about the money. Look, I want to be inviting to the United States, but should we not put our people first in some cases?\n\nIs this really the nature of college athletics? I mean the whole goal of the lawsuit is to drive more money towards the power 5 schools. Most schools will not have the ability to scholarship 105 football players. And after all, what do we go to college for? To get a higher education. Instead, the NCAA is worried about seven figure contracts for students. Don't get me wrong; I do think that these football players do deserve a piece of the pie for the revenue they bring in, but do we really have to cancel Olympic sports because they aren't as profitable? Is NCAA for student-athletes or for the money filled power five football programs? I wish XC could make money. We work just as hard as the football teams. We work our asses off for four years just to try to walk on to a program to try to be a great runner one day and enjoy being a college runner, after all we all are amateurs. I don't ask to be overly funded, just to be able to compete and enjoy the sport. But nope, we are too worried about making sure the football programs can fund their $100 million dollar training facilities. \n\nI understand that football funds a majority of our sports, but what is the nature of college sports? Is it the new professional league or is it to give high school students the opportunity to compete at a higher level? I am just frustrated. I want to just be able to walk on and run D1 and enjoy the sport for what it is, but the NCAA is too worried about limiting the amount of people on these programs that are already underfunded. I am frustrated the person who filed the case was a swimmer, and their sport will be affected as hard as ours will be. The NCAA should be for all student athletes, not just football, not just money making programs. The NCAA should help all sports. ",

I thought some other first timers who are aiming for around 5 hours would be interested in my training and my experience.\n\n### Race Information\n* **Name:** Brighton Marathon\n* **Date:** 6th April 2025\n* **Distance:** 42.4km\n* **Location:** Brighton, UK\n* **Website:** https://www.londonmarathonevents.co.uk/brighton-marathon-weekend\n* **Strava:** https://www.strava.com/activities/14098582527\n* **Time:** 4:50:41\n* **Age:** 34\n* **Gender:** Woman\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Start & Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 5 hours | *Yes* |\n| C | Sub 7min/km (4:55) | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometre | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 7:05\n| 2 | 6:26\n| 3 | 6:46\n| 4 | 6:39\n| 5 | 6:33\n| 6 | 6:27\n| 7 | 6:29\n| 8 | 6:30\n| 9 | 6:39\n| 10 | 6:34\n| 11 | 6:55\n| 12 | 6:35\n| 13 | 6:38\n| 14 | 6:56\n| 15 | 6:48\n| 16 | 6:51\n| 17 | 6:48\n| 18 | 7:02\n| 19 | 6:26\n| 20 | 6:47\n| 21 | 6:44\n| 22 | 6:33\n| 23 | 6:44\n| 24 | 6:31\n| 25 | 6:46\n| 26 | 6:51\n| 27 | 6:46\n| 28 | 6:50\n| 29 | 6:49\n| 30 | 6:53\n| 31 | 7:03\n| 32 | 7:05\n| 33 | 7:03\n| 34 | 7:10\n| 35 | 7:06\n| 36 | 7:30\n| 37 | 7:21\n| 38 | 7:07\n| 39 | 7:24\n| 40 | 7:43\n| 41 | 7:20\n| 42 | 7:01\n\n### Training\nI started a 16 week sub-5 marathon training plan from Runner's World back in November, taking a 3 week 'break' for a trip to NZ over Christmas (just continuing to run as often as I could while travelling), then repeating a couple of weeks when I got back to then catch back up with the schedule. It worked really well for me, but at one point I was unsure if I was doing enough and asked for advice on Reddit, which was a mistake. I was told I was not doing enough volume at all. Turns out that was wrong!\n\nI was doing 3 runs a week: one easy, one intervals/tempo and one long run. And then optionally a 4th run, normally a parkrun, if I was having a good week. I know the wisdome is that 4 runs should be minimum for marathon training, but this was what I was able to fit in and what I felt comfortable committing to. I maxed out at 30.5km for my long run, four weeks before the race, which took me 3 hours 40 mins. Where I live is very hilly, so I knew that my training runs were always going to be much harder than the race, which was good.\n\nI probably should have done one more long run with 3 weeks to go, but I had a niggle in my knee and was also on my feet a lot rehearsing for a show. So I decided against it in order to avoid injury. I was nervous all during taper that I'd messed things up by not doing that long run. But I had to convince myself that missing one run wasn't going to make or break the months of training before tha.\n\nOn top of the running, I did one strength training session at home per week, focusing on legs, core and ankles. Occasionally I did a yoga session too. And most weeks I went to Zumba. I was meant to swim each week as well, but basically didn't.\n\n### Pre-race\nLots of pasta and bread in the 2 days before! My husband was also racing, so we stayed in a tiny old cute hotel within 10mins walk of the park where the marathon started, and had a nice Italian meal the night before. We were able to have a relaxed morning with our start times of 9:45 and 10:28 respectively - even doing our last loo stops in the hotel! I got pretty nervous when I walked into the park and saw how huge the event was and how many people there were. But I breathed and calmed myself down before my wave was called.\n\n### Race\nI was aiming to stay between 6:45 and 7:00 min/km in order to hit my goal time. There were kms in the first half where I went faster than this, but I was using my body to tell me what was feeling good, and often these were downhill kms. So I don't think I went too fast at the start. I also knew that since this was my first marathon I was definitely going to slow down near the end whatever happened, so banking at least some time made me feel better. Essentially for the first half I was just making sure that each km felt like the same level of easy effort.\n\nI had support from my family all through the first third in the centre of town which was so nice. And then we headed out of town along the coast to the East, and, although it was uphill, it was beautiful and I was still feeling good. Turning around at 18km and seeing the cliffs and then running downhill back into Brighton was amazing. The middle section down by the sea from 24 to 28km was pretty tedious as there was minimal support. The day was also very very sunny, and there was no shade or relief from the direct heat.\n\nIt was almost comical that exactly at 30km my knee started hurting, and I definitely slowed down. But the slowdown wasn't too bad - I wouldn't say I hit 'the wall'. I stayed in the 7 mins\\km rather than ever going up to 8. After 35km things got worse and I really had to dig deep and force myself to believe I could do it, pushing through the exhaustion. But once I got to 40km it seemed doable, and I just went for it. I was SO HAPPY to come in well under 5 hours, which had been my main goal for the whole of training! And I didn't walk or stop at all either. Coming across the line I just cried - I never thought that in my life this is something that I would achieve.\n\n### Nutrition\nI took a 30g carb gel or chew every 35 minutes (Precision Fuel) and had an electrolyte/carb mix in a water bladder to drink whenever I wanted. I carried 1.5l but only drank just over 500ml, so carried an extra kg all the way round for no reason! I was also drinking every electrolyte drink they gave out round the course and mostly using the provided water to cool myself down. I didn't need the loo at all on the course and my stomach handles gels and chews just fine.\n\n### Post-race\nImmeditely after the race I staggered to get my medal, cried a bit more, found my bag and then sat down near a meeting point hoping that my family would find me. My husband had finished in an amazing 2:57 (a PB for him) and so we both crashed. We had to get a minibus back to our park and ride, but eventually drove our way to a pub, where I tried to drink half a pint, and successfully ate most of a fish and chips. My husband was not so lucky and was feeling pretty ropey - he threw up a couple of times on the course and his stomach wouldn't handle any food even a few hours after. He eventually felt better at about 9pm and ate his pub lunch leftovers.\n\nToday I am working from home on the sofa, in my dressing gown, with my medal on. As little movement as possible is happening.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.",

My main reason for leaving the apple eco system is that I was convinced my heart rate was just so off. \n\nWhenever I would race a 5k my average heart rate would be 200bpm (about 3-5bpm off my max heart rate) and around 180-198bpm on most other runs. Obviously this is very high and I was convinced I was fitter than this.\n\nI've seen a slight improvement since switching to garmin. With an average HR of 166bpm on an easy 10mile run.\n\nI've seen some people on here say they only noticed a discrepancy of around 5bpm when using a chest strap compared to an optical watch sensor. I've assumed that most of the people in these discussions are fairer skinned.\n\nTL/DR\nBasically my question is, for other black people, have you noticed a difference in the heart rate measurement when using a chest strap compared to a watch?\n\nObviously non-black people feel free to weigh in with your own experience and expertise!",

Over twelve weeks or so, I tried to make my longest run in a week go farther than the one two weeks before. Then I would \u201chold\u201d for four weeks alternating at 18mi and 14mi before tapering from 22mi to 10mi in the last four weeks before. Other runs would be mostly casual, attempting to go distances and times without looking too much on milage. I averaged about 40mi/wk. Unfortunately, *last* year they postponed for two weeks for a freak blizzard, *then* I suffered a fall in the gym earning a rib contusion. I deferred to this year. For this year, after registering, I learned I got into Tokyo, which ended up sorta becoming my long-run in the taper down as mentioned. (Note: I did not perform well in Tokyo, a developing cold and dehydration from poor nutrition on vacation may have been the culprit for a my time.) I clocked 3h39m in Tokyo this March, hit a 1h32m at the NYC Half two weeks later, then suffered food poisoning a week after that.\n\n### Pre-race\nAbout two days before, organizers published a livestream explaining the race and unique start procedure. The bib number and my precise start time \u2013 7:46:08AM \u2013 was also revealed, more on this later. Millennium Running in Bedford, NH, played host to the packet pickup. Everything was quite smooth, no additional tools nor ID\u2019s needed for pickup. To quote the organizer, \u201cif we have people stealing bib numbers for this race, we got larger problems in society.\u201d It was easy to pick up the bib and I bought some swag, at a reasonable US$20. Nutrition-wise, it\u2019s a carbohydrate heavy two days before the race, with lighter portions the day before to prevent bloat. Bagels, coffee, whey, yogurt, bananas, chicken parm, jelly beans (tons)\u2026\n\nFor some reason, last night\u2019s chicken parm decided to have a little revenge. I added Pepto to my pre-race nutrition (two bagels, one banana, 3Tbsp peanut butter; 4 Gu for the course, 4 electrolyte tabs, 20fl oz H2O).\n\nThey do have bag check at this race, though since you\u2019re parking relatively close to the starting area anyway, you don\u2019t need to check much if anything. I arrived to the area at 6:40AM or so, and found street parking easy (for *that* time of day).\n\n### Race\nThe start procedure is \"time trial inspired.\" Everyone is seeded based on what time they input as a predicted finish time during registration. (Launching separated pairs of runners with near-enough pace expectations prevents dodging, weaving, and crowding on the course\u2019s narrow bike path.)  The last two digits of your bib are your \"cone number,\u201d the first two digits are your group. The first pair of the first group (e.g. bibs #101 and #102) start at the same time, seven seconds later the next pair (#103, #104) go, and so forth, hence the specific start \u2013 be in your group ten minutes before and get to your cone when they call your group up! Seconds before you're up, your name shows up first as \u201con deck,\u201d then on the LED board with huge letters and countdown timer. 3..2..1.. go, drag race style.\n\nThis made it really easy for me to get into the race groove, as I had someone next to me already with a  relatively identical pace. It also meant there was a little bit of a gap to the people ahead, and virtually no clumping on a narrow rail-trail course.  I was jiving along, running at about 7:30/mi (4:40/km).\n\nThe course was a paved out and back rail trail, with four police-protected road crossings. Marathoners traverse it twice. While the trail was indeed narrow, it was still easy to get around. Mind the rare small cracks and divots in the pavement, which could trip you up. Scenery was woods-like, as one could expect for New England, which even in the budding of springtime with brown trees and patches of ice on rocks was still a spectacle to behold. There is a hairpin turn around mile 6.1 into the lap, there was no congestion for me, yet I fear I tripped the person next to me? No one fell? The path undulated slightly, with sensations of going \u201cuphill both ways/.\u201d Certainly not \u201cpancake flat\u201d \u2013 [Jim Thorpe Area Running Festival Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/135h5ym/jim_thorpe_area_running_festival_marathon_2023/) holds that record!\n\nWater stops were about 3-ish miles apart, and the cold weather (30\u2019s F with wind chill) and gray skies did not dehydrate me as I was sapped in Tokyo. Still having the extra water with me did help. (Unlike Tokyo, runner-carried hydration is allowed alongside nutrition, just make sure to throw away your trash in the appropriate bins on course.) They supplied both water and Gatorade at all stops, with Gu chews also available at about miles 3/9/15/21. By this point, I took my own Gu gels at miles 3, and 8. At mile 12, I was feeling good, my hamstrings were getting a good burn. The only sizable hill occurred on the northbound side of that turnaround. \n\nFull marathoners exited right from the trail at mile 12.5 to complete a street loop and go south through the course again. Half-marathoners were launching at this time, now 14-seconds apart. (The pace of those runners was timed to approximate the pace of the marathoners starting their second loop. Again, masterclass in coordination.) My third Gu went down easy at mile 13.5. Around mile 15/16 I felt some cramping wanting to start, and had two electrolyte tabs. My fourth Gu \u2013 chocolate coconut! \u2013 came around mile 18 or so. My pace started to slip since the start of lap 2, and only dropped 20s/mi (12s/km) by the end. The gradual hills bit me. \n\nAt the end of loop 2, marathoners turned right to finish the course. That hill somehow did not feel as steep as on loop one, and I dumped what I had in the final 200m.\n\n### Post-race\nThe announcers were energetic and appropriately funny, for example referring to a runner\u2019s home state of Ohio as \u201cnational champion Buckeye\u2019s home.\u201d After crossing the line, you get your ribbon \u2013 no medals here, but it\u2019s still highly unique. They offer bananas, yogurt packs, pretzels, and so forth. Aid is immediately available (as it was on course), as were post-race photo ops in front of \u201cI BQ\u2019d\u201d signs and a PR bell to ring. I finished with a personal best, shaving 2m 25s off my previous mark. \n\nFrom there, I lingered around for a half hour to do some shopping at the vendors there before headed back home. I realized that I felt *really* good. My hydration may have been on point, my nutrition was likely spot on. No cramping, no headache, no nausea. Credit may go to a high high protein diet for the two weeks before and focusing on simple carbs. The lesson learned from Tokyo is to force and monitor water intake the week prior to a race.\n\n### TL;DNR?\nGreat organized race with time trial start, be sure to watch the livestream/replay the days beforehand to get an understanding of start procedure. Expect cool weather, great support, and an exceeds-expectations on value for dollar. Plus, there are a few of local diners and coffeeshops at which to buy yourself treats afterwards.\n\n\n*Edit: Clarified grammar in some parts.*",

I've been using Runna for all my training plans for the past few years.\n\nI signed up for the Berlin Half marathon around 11 months ago, setting my sights on a SuperHalfs medal after finishing London Marathon last year. Runna predicted I'd be able to complete the Berlin Half between 01:37 and 01:41 with a goal km split of 4:40.\n\nI hit the required splits pretty much consistently across all my training runs, barring two key long runs at race pace where I wasn't able to hit 4:40 pace (both runs had two 6k blocks with easy miles in between). One of those was on a particularly windy day on vacation where my selected route was also hillier that I anticipated, the other I attributed to old running shoes but I could also be distracting myself from the fact that maybe I wasn't fit enough.\n\nI'm pretty familiar with Runna and the programs it offers so there was nothing out of the ordinary/nothing I wasn't used to. I did four runs a week and had their strength training built into my running plan as well. Mileage peaked at around 60km across several of the weeks in the plan.\n\nI generally slept pretty well over the course of the training block, with the exception of a couple days before race day due to travel to Berlin.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI started getting a bit nervous about race day on the day I went to the expo (Friday), but I was able to keep the nerves at bay somewhat over the course of Friday by doing some sightseeing and seeing some friends who lived in Berlin. We went to an improv show in the evening, which basically quelled my nerves for the next couple of days. Saturday was also a pretty nerve-free day, again doing some sightseeing to pass the time and take my mind off things. \n\nI started to get nervous on race morning, which I know is normal, but the nerves were caused by my Garmin morning report (something I've heard many people say to avoid but it can be quite hard to ignore). I felt pretty fresh, despite not sleeping well the night before. The reason for the poorer sleep was more due to eating a bit too much for dinner rather than nerves. I was mindful of ensuring I was eating enough,  but wasn't as dialled in with carb loading as I was when I did the marathon. \n\nI had a hard time eating breakfast at the hotel, sticking to things like bread and eggs. Again, not something I had planned, was just basing my food choices off of things I know go down well as well as seeing what other people were eating (there were a lot of half marathon runners at the hotel I was staying in).\n\n# Race\n\nI have been guilty of being far too fixated on an A goal in the past and spent a lot of time before the race hashing out B and C goals. I really wanted a sub-1:40 but I needed to understand that it's not the end of the world as sometimes race day conditions don't always go in your favour and neither does training. \n\nWith that being said, it was a very cold morning (about 4 degrees, with a RealFeel of 0 degrees). I didn't pack a warmer back up outfit and I think I could've done with a longer and more thorough warm up as well. Because it was so cold, I had a hard time trying to control my breathing for the first 2-3km and get comfortable with the task at hand. \n\nI got quite frustrated for the first 10km as there were quite a few people who started before me who were running considerably slower than me. This was the one thing about the race I didn't like, but I did make up about a 1000 places over the course of the race. Participants were asked about their personal bests (I inputted mine as my previous PB), rather than expected finishing times, before the race so I'm wondering if people were inputting times they didn't achieve recently. This combined with the very cold start did throw me off a bit during this portion of the race. \n\nAs the race went on and struggling to hit the splits provided by Garmin PacePro (I set a pretty conservative negative split), I reminded myself how important it is to be able to race as well as get to the start line. I think my fuelling strategy worked (SIS Beta at 30 and 1:30 mark, with a SIS Beta Nootropics at the hour mark) as that helped me tick over and did get a nice little boost for a bit when I took the nootropics gel. It was also around this point that I spotted my friends around Potsdamer Platz and got a nice boost of energy. \n\nEven if I couldn't keep up with the PacePro splits, I was able to maintain a strong pace and didn't fall off in the second half and finished with negative splits. I also felt more comfortable in the second half of the course as the roads were much wider and open compared to the first half. \n\n# Post-race and Reflections\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, I collected my medal and looked forward to a shower and a free Erdinger afterwards. I've never been to a race that had showers in the finishers' area, which was very welcome even if the hot water wasn't working. \n\nI achieved my C goal and I'm still really happy with how the race went despite the conditions as I ran a negative split and finished the race strong. The result I achieved meant that I finished outside the predicted finishing time given to me by Runna, but I do wonder how much would've changed had the weather been more favourable. Looking at runs from last year and 2023, it looks as though the weather can alter between quite cold and quite warm year to year. I did also mention having a pretty big dinner the night before the race, but I and my legs did not in any way feel sluggish because of this. On the other hand, the splits I hit in key long runs in training plans for a half or full marathon before race day are usually a strong indicator of how I finish on race day (even if a training run is a month or more away from race day). \n\nIt's a really great course with loads of long straights to help hit your stride and the finish at the Brandenburg Gate is pretty special (must feel even better during the marathon!), even if the first half can feel congested due to the narrower roads.\n\nIn hindsight, I think I need to prepare myself better for conditions that aren't in my favour as trying to power through rather than adapt could've also hampered me slightly.\n\nI've got a couple of halves in October, but wondering if I can have another crack at the sub 1:40 before then.

    "selftext": "Race Information  \nName: Philly LOVE Run Half Marathon  \nDate: March 30, 2025  \nDistance: 13.1 Miles  \nLocation: Philadelphia, PA  \nTime: 1:43:46  \n\nGoals  \n\nGoal Description\n\nCompleted?  \nA Sub 1:55 - Yes!  \nB Sub 1:50 - Yes!  \nC Sub 1:45 - Yes!   \n\nSplits - Mile\tTime  \n1\t8:08  \n2\t7:51  \n3\t8:10  \n4\t7:50  \n5\t7:59  \n6\t7:41  \n7\t7:43  \n8\t7:58  \n9\t7:39  \n10\t7:46  \n11\t7:58  \n12\t7:32  \n13\t7:34  \n14\t6:57  \n\nTime: 1:43:46   \n\nTraining   \nBeen training for about 10 weeks total. Up until training for this race I never really ran with any sort of commitment or goal. Never played sports growing up. I started running as a means to improve my cardio for Muay Thai. I was really struggling during heavy drills and sparring to keep my shit together.\nOnce I got into it something clicked and I was like \"I kind of like how this feels\" so I dove in and signed up for a race. My intention was to do the Broad Street Run as my first. I didn't get in to the lottery which was a bummer at first so I decided to sign up for the HM (which is about 5 weeks sooner than Broad Street).  \n\nI started around 10mpw my first week and jumped right to around 20mpw in my second. I added around 3-5mpw finally peaking at 56mpw at the end of my training block. It's worth noting that even though I haven't run much, I am active so I came in with a fitness base. I backed off mileage two weeks out to 46mpw and the did 20mpw for my final taper. I did  not follow a program but I've done enough reading to know the principles of running and my training consisted of the typical long, tempo, threshold, interval & easy runs.  \n\nInjuries   \nIt shouldn't be a surprise when I say that I definitely increased volume too fast and I've been nursing some injuries. For most of my training I've been dealing with Posterior Tibial Tendonitis in my left foot. I have been doing a combination of strengthening PT exercises, compression, KT tape, mobility and stretching work to manage it. It sucks but it's something I've been able to tolerate and I'm hoping it improves after I back milage off. Additionally I had a runners knee flare up but that only lasted a few weeks and it's not been bothering me. I'm a larger runner at around 6'0 195 so dropping some lbs should help w injuries. I carb loaded for about 4 days leading up to the race so was definitely heavy from that as well.   \n\nPre-Race    \nAlarm went off at 4:45. Ate my usual breakfast of oatmeal w/ protein powder & had some coffee to clear myself out. I also ate a gel to see how my body responded. I know you shouldn't do anything new on race day but I suck at listening. No problems to report. Got ready and then was out the door around 6:15. I live in South Philly so I decided to take the subway up to City Hall and walk to the start. My train was supposed to arrive at 6:29, but SEPTA decided to SEPTA (iykyk) and the train arrived 10 minutes late. I was contemplating a few options if it didn't show up and neither were great. Either pay for a $55 Uber or run 3 miles to the race. Thankfully everything worked out, train showed up at 6:39, and it was all good.  \n\nRace   \nNerves were feeling pretty good before the race. The most stressful part to me was just the volume of people and commuting there. It was around 13k, which I know is small compared to some, but it was my first race so it was a lot. My bib put me in a slower corral than I was supposed to so I snuck up from Green to Blue. I was trying to find the 1:45 pacer but no luck (found him way later in the race).  \n\nMiles 1-5  \nThe first 4.5 miles do a small route through Center City Philadelphia. Felt surreal running through the streets without traffic. There were crowds cheering through certain sections there, not too many onlookers though. Legs were feeling fresh and fast from the taper and I was being mindful of not starting too fast. First mile or so was lots of weaving and passing folks.   \n\nMiles 5-10  \nHere's where I started to feel settled in and could really start to push a little harder. Legs, heart and lungs still felt pretty great throughout this section. Miles 5-10 take you up along the Schuylkill River on Kelly & MLK drive. Around mile 7 or 8 my left ankle (PTT) really was starting to flare up. I pushed through as usual but it definitely was not pleasant. I hit my first aide station in this section and also ate a gel right beforehand around mile 8.  \n\nMiles 10-13.1  \nThis is where the race really started. Those who've done this HM know right around mile 10 there's a pretty steep and long hill. I was able to keep pace going uphill but my heart rate made it up to around 180. This was definitely challenging and it took a lot of runners down to a slow jog or walking. I was a bit worried because the bulk of my training has been on a treadmill so I haven't worked much with grade. What pushed me through was the fact that I have extremely strong legs from decades of strength training. Knowing this was a hilly course I tried my best to pick up my pace in the downhills and flats to bank some time. I was definitely feeling spent after the hill and had to start digging deep to maintain my pace. Somewhere around mile 11 or 12 I finally saw the 1:45 pacer. I felt such a relief to know I was on track for my stretch goal of 1:45. I passed him and kept pushing to the end. I gave everything I had in the last .1.  \n\nPost-Race  \nAfter catching my breath I grabbed my medal and hobbled over to the big food tent to get my bag of snacks. Hobbled two miles to my buddy's house and we went out for brunch. Really great experience overall.  \n\nLessons learned & what's next \nOverall I think I did a fantastic job training for this race. I'm really proud of myself for the effort I put into training & the race itself. I gave this everything I had and took it very seriously. In hindsight I would have pushedy milage up a bit slower & trained with an insole to help mitigate the PTT. I'm flat footed so I gotta be more careful. I also didn't need to peak at 56 miles, that was overkill. I am looking forward to dialing the milage back to 25-30mpw and doing a heavier focus on speed. I'm also looking forward to doing more running outside now that it's warming, and more trail runs. I have a few 10ks lined up which will be a nice change from HM training. I have the Philadelphia Marathon in the fall so I'll be back to the grind late summer. I will probably follow a real program for that one. No idea what time to shoot for yet as there's a lot of training to be had before then. Also, for anyone curious, my Garmin race predictor had me around 1:42:30 for this. So all things considered that was pretty damn close. Also my watch put my total distance at 13.3 miles and that's what my splits are based on. It was a super cloudy day so I think it struggled a bit w gps.  \n\nI'm sure I forgot some stuff. Happy to answer questions if anyone has any. Thanks for reading!",

I came from a pretty aerobic base, having played soccer in high school and ultimate in college. I trained for and ran a half marathon with a few friends in August 2024. The day before, we realized it was a trail half marathon. Let's just say that the experience was one I would never forget. First half marathon + 1,700 feet of elevation gain.\n\nI had trained hard for that race, and although I was proud of my performance (2:01), I knew I could do much better. But I never set a timeline for the next race; I was hooked on running but I was also exhausted and demotivated. I found weight training to be a lot easier than running, so I focused on the former. I still ran once a week, but averaged around 5 miles at an easier (for me) pace (8:30-8:45). \n\nDuring winter break (December 2024 - January 2025), I came back home from college and bumped into some family who were all runners. They convinced me to sign up for a marathon which would take place in October. \n\nWhen I went back to college, I started building on my base. I generally walk around 5-7 miles a day so my cardio base is always there. My ever-supportive parents got me a Garmin Forerunner 245 for my birthday; it's now my best friend. I only ran around 12 miles a week over two days, but it was better than before, and I was having fun.\n\nIn February, I noticed (on Strava, the best social media app) that one of my friends (call him A) who had ran the last half with me was also running. I reached out, asking if he wanted to run a 10k together in late March when we both had spring break and would be back home. He suggested we do a half marathon instead. \n\nI had trained for over 5 months for the last one. Now I would only have one month. My brain told me not to do it. So I said yes. We signed up for the Western Pacific Half Marathon, a significantly flatter race than the one prior. I was nervous. \n\n\n\\### Training\n\nI kept the 2-run a week schedule. In hindsight, I wished I bumped it up to more. It's not like I couldn't--I was doing weight training or core/flexibility work the other 5 days. \n\nI'm a morning runner, so most of my runs were in 45-50 degree weather starting around 5:30/5:45 AM. My longer runs were on Saturday and generally began around 6:15 AM. The comparatively shorter run was on Wednesday, and I was pretty strict about start time, especially because I had early classes.\n\nI progressively increased mileage after signing up. I had about 5 weeks of training time.\n\n\\## Week 1 (total mileage: 12; 4.7 (wednesday) and 7.3 (saturday):\n\nI remember feeling pretty good this week. My pace was all over the place, though, ranging from about 8:10 on the short run and 8:30 on the longer run. I go to school in a hilly place, so elevation gain was around 500ft +.\n\nMy routes were pretty well established at this time. However, I found myself getting bored on my \"long\" runs, so I decided to motivate myself by running to breakfast spots nearby and taking the bus back. \n\n\\## Week 2 (total mileage: 14.84; 5.96 (wednesday) and 8.88 (saturday):\n\nThe Wednesday run was on very little sleep. It was quite windy and cold, and there was around 600 feet of elevation gain. I ran at a slower 8:30 pace, but better than no pace and no run. \n\nI rewarded myself with that Saturday longer run for sure, getting three massive  bagels with tofu cream cheese. The second half of this run was with a friend, but I was actually faster (8:16/mi pace) because it was largely a downhill run. \n\n\\## Week 3 (total mileage: 14.59; 6.06 (wednesday) and 8.53 (saturday):\n\nWednesday run was the exact same as the prior week, but I was a bit faster at a 8:23 pace.\n\nI'm a morning runner but I ran the Saturday run in the afternoon because I was out until 1 am that morning. Honestly, I didn't want to run. It also didn't help that it was at the same time as a home basketball game against our rival. But sacrifices must be made. \n\nAlthough it was a shorter run than the prior week, it was the toughest yet, with 800 feet of elevation gain. I ran at a 8:40 pace.\n\n\\## Week 4 (total mileage: 15.77; 6.14 (wednesday) and 9.63 (saturday):\n\nWednesday run was more of the same, but I was slower. This was frustrating, and I thought I could redeem myself on Saturday. \n\nAgain, I ran to a breakfast spot with a friend at a conversational pace, but I did get a 15k PR in the process! \n\nThis was the week before finals; honestly, the Saturday run was a great start to the week and I'm happy I decided to run instead of study.\n\n\\## Week 5 (total mileage: 16.24; 6.08 (wednesday) and 10.16 (saturday):\n\nLast week before taper!\n\nWednesday = groundhog day, except I had a final exam to complete as soon as I finished my run! I ran through a stomachache and in hindsight, I really shouldn't have done that.\n\nI came back home on Thursday and got ready for my long run on Saturday. Since I was back home, I started a bit later than usual. My heartrate and power were at threshold by mile 4, which I knew was a bad sign. I slowed down and ended up completing the run at a 8:39 pace.\n\nThis performance was disappointing to say the least. There was roughly 600 feet of elevation gain, but I thought I could do it at sub 8:30. I still got a PR in the 10 mile.\n\n\n\\### Taper Week\n\nI broke all the rules I set for myself for this week. Coming back home for break is always a blast; my family and friends are here and home food is the best! \n\nBut my friends and family are quite active. After my long run on Saturday, I wanted to work out daily (lifting or HIIT + cardio) and walk my dog (~3-6 miles a day), but I did not want to run or do anything excessive. But this was the only week I would see my friends for a while, so I couldn't say no to anything. \n\nMonday was good. I did nothing excessive and felt great. On Tuesday, I got it in my head that I should do a shakeout run. Terrible idea. I completed a 4.26 mile run at a 8:22 pace, but I felt terrible at the end and wanted to throw up by mile 3.\n\nMore than anything, this dented my confidence. My ankles were also significantly swollen. I continued my bad decision making by playing badminton with friends right after my run. \n\nOn Wednesday, I did a 6 mile hike (2100 feet of elevation gain) with friends in roughly 2 hours, which only worsened the swelling. When I got back, I headed straight to the city with some other friends and spent the day walking. 30k steps that day.\n\nThursday morning, my ankles were the size of lemons. I did nothing except light walking and some mobility and core exercises. \n\nOn Friday I did some upper body strength training and walked my dog. The pain in my ankles had subsided but I was still scared.\n\nThe race was at 8 AM, so I slept around 9 PM Friday night. \n\nA lot of folks talk about carb loading. I didn't carb load per se, I just ate a lot during the week. Home food hits different. For hydration, I generally drink around ~4 liters (~140 ounces) of water a day, and I didn't change that during the week. \n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nGot up around 6, took a massive dump, and then ate a peanut butter sandwich with a few oranges. Finished a massive bottle of water.\n\nMy friend, A, swung by to pick me up around 7:10 and we got to the race around 7:30. Checked in, dropped my bag off, and put one headphone (right earbud only) in. I would have liked to use the restroom but we got there too late. \n\nStill, I was excited by the number of people and how official the race looked. There were pacers and six aid stations. In my first half marathon, there were only two aid stations and no pacers. \n\nThen I messed up. Kind of. \n\nThere was a big crowd at the starting line and I made my way to the front. I got it into my head that the 1:40 pacer was best for me and my goals because that meant an 8 minute mile pace. My math was the following:\n\n8 * 60 = 140. Don't ask me where I got the 60 from or how I got 140 at the end of that calculation. \n\nSo I stood awkwardly towards the start of the crowd, waiting for the race to begin. \n\n\n\\### Race\n\n\\## Miles 1-3:\n\nThis part was relatively flat and downhill. My music playlist was geared to exactly the right songs, but I know I went out too fast. My second mile split was 7:29, about a minute faster than my training. \n\nAs I ran past the beautiful lakeside scenery, two thoughts were dueling in my mind. I felt good, even though I was going fast. But I always read horror stories about people going out too fast. I felt great but by the end of the third mile, I knew this was not sustainable.\n\n\\## Miles 4-6:\n\nAnother flat portion in a race of flat portions. I made the conscious decision to slow down here but still pace myself by keeping the 1:40 pacer in my view. A few racers then caught up with me and I decided to run with them for a while. After mile 5, there was a nice downhill portion under a bridge that came up after about 20 feet. I sped up here and was met with cheering volunteers at an aid station on the other side. I downed a cup of water while running and tossed it in the trash.\n\nThe water gave me a small boost and I found myself alone again, between the 1:40 group and the folks who I was running with prior.\n\nMy split for the first 6 miles was 46:14 with an average heart rate of 154. \n\n\\## Miles 7-9:\n\nAt this point, I realized that I could run at a sub-8 pace. I still hadn't convinced myself that this was sustainable, so I decided to distract myself.\n\nAfter going around a lake, the route takes racers along a creek. This is an out-and-back portion. I got to the turnaround and 50 seconds later, I bumped into A.\n\nAt least I would beat my friend! This gave me an energy boost and I sped up. As I passed racers headed in the other direction, I tried to give each of them a fist bump, high five, or say something positive. When I passed runners doing a 10k, I kept that practice up. This took my mind off of the run but it also slowed me down (my excuse for the mile 8 split). \n\n\\## Miles 10-12:\n\nThe 1:40 pacing group was slowly leaving my sight line here. As I sped up, Gotye's \"Somebody that I used to Know\" came on, and I remembered my first ever \"major\" run from 3 years ago: a hilly 8-miler at a 7:43 pace. If I could do that then, I can do anything know, I thought.\n\nI ran faster, pushing myself, and it paid off. I got some more water from an aid station but I knew I couldn't finish it before I got to the trash can, so I spilled it over my head. This gave me another energy boost.\n\nMy split for the second 6 miles was 46:56 with an average heart rate of 168. \n\n\\## Home stretch:\n\nThe finish line was in site but I wasn't there just yet. The grade was downhill so I picked up the pace for the 13th mile, running at 7:36.\n\nThere wasn't any pain or cramping, but I was definetely out of breath. I also began to regret not using the restroom prior to lining up at the start. No matter; I literally had 8 minutes until I could get that relief. \n\nAt this point, my playlist went back to the start. Although I had queued up 2 hours worth of music, I had skipped some songs (sorry Beatles!).\n\nI ran as fast as I could for the last 0.5 miles and heard my name on the speaker as I crossed the finish line. \n\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI'm still shocked at my overall pace of 7:45/mile (according to Strava). This was much faster than any of my training runs. I think a large factor was the lack of elevation change in the race (~100 feet). But I can save that analyzing for another day.\n\nAfter crossing the finish line, I downed a bottle of water and then went back to the finish line to record A. I waited for about 10 minutes before he came through. We embraced at the end and then I used the restroom (much needed!).\n\nI ate a few bananas and then went to see if I won a medal for my age group. The volunteers informed me that I had, and gave me a vintage medal that the organizers were discontinuing. I then went and thanked the 1:40 pacer. \n\nMy family said that they would be at the finish line to record me but they showed up right after. I helped my sister get some more snacks for herself before leaving the venue with A to grab brunch.\n\nI've never devoured a veggie burrito faster. \n\nWhen I got home, I took a long shower and went to the race website to see my photos. I was really happy that they weren't behind a watermark. I'm extremely grateful to the volunteer photographers for the work that they do. I'll definetely be on the page in the next few days as more photos are uploaded. \n\nThere's still a lot of reflecting that I have to do. I'm not sure how my taper played a role or why I was so much faster than my training runs. I was falling out of running in November and December of 2024, but now I love it again. Running makes me happy. I should do what makes me happy. \n\nI'll probably wait a week before running again, though. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you! I apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors. \n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by u/herumph.",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Seeking advice from others who love running, but their body doesn't always agree. \n\nStory version: Running was my (33F) first love. I feel like I non-stopped ran/played as a child. Then, in middle school I started running the mile and 800m competitively. I was good and I loved it. When I got to high school, I started running cross country and continued to excel. But, then, I got hurt. I ran so much that I got a stress fracture in my shin. I had an MRI and then PT, and then custom orthotic for my right shoe. I had to stop running for a bit. I came back and was never the same. I went from 6-7 minute miles to 10 minute miles. Since then, I've run on and off. I still love running, but it seems every time I get in the groove (running 3+ times/week), I get injured. I'm constantly battling the shin splints and occasionally have had other issues such as IT band and foot pain. I wear stability shoes because of my hx of problems. I do all the things - strength work, balancing work, stretching, ab work, building up, etc. I'd love to be able to run far and even train for a 5k - 10k again. Right now, I'm doing about 2.5 miles several times a week and feel the shin splints again (on both legs). \n\nI'm wondering if there are any others who've had a similar experience? Is this just the way it goes for some people? Do you just do it on and off for the rest of time? It bums me out to love something so much that doesn't love me back hahaha. ",

    "title": "Wahoo Kickr Run treadmill (and Peloton Tread comparison)",
    "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with Wahoo or Peloton in any way. Paid full retail for both treadmills. Stand nothing to gain from this post financially (but if Wahoo wants to send me one of those cool Headwind fans, I will accept). I paid $***5,737.24**\u00a0after tax and shipping for the Kickr Run, and previously paid $**3,565.76**\u00a0for the Peloton Tread with the extended protection plan.\n\n**Background**: I'm a consistent recreational runner, probably 80% indoors. 6' \\~170 lbs, run about 30-45 miles per week. Live in Austin, so an indoor running option is clutch for a good part of the year.\n\nI've had the Peloton Tread for over 3 years now and put a lot of miles on it, so it makes sense for me to compare the two. Hope you find it useful.\n\nI've spent the last several months researching treadmills, as the extended warranty on the Tread is almost up and it's had several meaningful repairs during the ownership period (3 deck replacements, plus one set of lateral support replacements.) I demo'd a number of treadmills at Johnson Fitness and watched countless YouTube videos before deciding to give the Kickr Run a try.\n\nI don't cycle anymore and have no prior experience with Wahoo, and they didn't have a Kickr Run in my area that I could test in advance. I'm confident they'd sell a lot of more if they had more of them set up in shops in major metros.\n\n**Delivery**: I'd read some less-than-ideal reviews of other delivery experiences with their delivery partner RXO. Mine was fine, and communication was good. Once they arrived, it took them about 45 minutes to unpack and set up. I think they got on the line with Wahoo's support team at one point, which isn't surprising given that this is a new device out in the world.\n\n**Setup**: I'd seen enough YouTube videos about the Kickr Run to know what to expect and some of the general operation. Once I powered on, the Wahoo app on my phone quickly found and connected to the Run and then connected the Run to my WiFi. It downloaded one update that took about 5 minutes, and the promoted a series of short videos on the app to acquaint me with the Run's controls. Very well done, quick and to the point.\n\n**Running Experience**: Part of the reason the Kickr Run appealed to me was the clean console and lack of a large screen. I'd already set up a TV on the wall in my garage so that I could choose from different apps, or just watch a show/movie for longer run days. The screen shaking on the Peloton Tread always annoyed me, especially at really any pace above a 9 min mile or at incline. It's one of the trade-offs of the Tread's design - it looks super clean and minimalist, but to achieve that, the attach point for the massive screen isn't enough ton hold it solid. And yes, I leveled the Tread.\n\nI actually had the Tread in the garage still after the Kickr Run was delivered, and it was shocking to see them side-by-side. The Wahoo just looks so much more commercial grade. The base is tall and beefy, the belt is longer and wider. It definitely takes up more space, so that's a consideration if you're constrained there.\n\nThe Kickr Run's beefier construction comes through in the run. It feels\u00a0*extremely*\u00a0solid and stable underfoot. With the Tread, it just always seemed a touch wobbly, as I mentioned before. Not so with the Wahoo.\n\nI found the Tread's controls to be responsive; that was never an issue. The Wahoo's are equally so, with some additional gestures for pace and include that allow for additional flexibility (ex: short taps, long holds, etc.).\n\n**Noise**: I've always felt the Tread to be acceptable noise-wise. It's not loud. The Kickr Run, however, is almost silent. It's crazy. When running, you really only hear your footfalls on the belt.\n\n**Misc**: I often use the Peloton Tread as a walking desk with an additional acrylic desk you can set on top. That didn't fit the Kickr Run, but the built-in desk at the front actually works pretty well for this, especially if I'm walking during a Zoom meeting or something where I'm more of a passive attendee vs. needing to type something out consistently.\n\n**Apps**: I mentioned before that I'm not a cyclist, so I don't have prior experience with Zwift or other apps. I'll try them out soon. Another reason I decided to move on from the Peloton Tread was that I was using the subscription less and less, and really only took classes from one favorite instructor (Matt Wilpers). At some point, I might use the Peloton app on my TV with the Kickr Run, which would be fine, because some of the integrated Tread features like the Leaderboard don't mean anything to me.\n\n**Overall Comparison**: It's not entirely fair to compare these two machines as apples to apples. The Kickr Run costs $2K more. With all the repair issues we've had with the Peloton Tread, I've come to feel that it's really designed to be used 3-5 times a week for an average of about 30-45 minutes at a time. Our usage was much more than that, and likely contributed to the repairs.\n\nTo their credit, Peloton support was always friendly, responsive and made good on those repairs. They're peculiar in that almost any issue with the Tread's base requires them to replace the whole base.\n\nThe Kickr Run is a more substantial, and powerful machine. The running surface is more stable, but I'd say both the Tread and the Kickr Run have a firmer feel underfoot, which I prefer. Some of the higher-end machines like TechnoGym and others almost feels like running on trampolines, to me. Someone said the Kickr Run's feel is a bit like \"packed dirt,\" and I think that's a good comparison.\n\nIf you love Peloton classes and the instructors, and only plan to run on it about 5 hours a week, it might be for you. It's still a good machine -\u00a0***but get the extended warranty***.\n\nOne of the reasons I initially hesitated on the Kickr Run was buying a Gen 1 device seemed risky to me. So far, it feels pretty polished.\n\nOne of the other drawbacks was their initial warranty offering (1 year) didn't seem like a lot of confidence in the product. They've since upgraded this to 5 years for frame, motor, and running belt, which is think is the right call at this price point. Many of the commercial machines at this price from somewhere like Johnson will have that, at a min, and many have lifetime warranty on core components.\n\nQuestions? Fire away, I'll do my best to answer.\n\n  \nUpdate: Have put about 150 miles on the Kickr Run now. Love it so much, it's a beast!",

    "selftext": "### Race Information\n* **Name:** Eastleigh 10k\n* **Date:** March 23 2025, 9:00am\n* **Distance:** 10 kilometers\n* **Location:** Eastleigh, Hampshire, UK\n* **Website:** https://www.runningmania.co.uk/eastleigh-10k/\n* **Time:** 45:22\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | 49:07 (New PB) | *Yes* |\n| B | 48:00 | *Yes* |\n| C | 47:00 | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometer | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 4:35\n| 2 | 4:36\n| 3 | 4:38\n| 4 | 4:43\n| 5 | 4:15\n| 6 | 4:32\n| 7 | 4:32\n| 8 | 4:33\n| 9 | 4:29\n| 10 | 4:21\n\n\n### Background\n\nThe Eastleigh 10k has always been one of my favourite races on the calendar. Fast, relatively flat and friendly, I've achieved new 10k personal bests on this course for a number of years. In 2023 I even ended up winning the prize for best improver for lowering my 2022 time of 1:06:31 to 49:19 12 months later. Held in the railway town of Eastleigh, a few miles north of the city of Southampton, this was the 40th anniversary of the race and the 39th edition owing to 2020's Covid cancellation. \n\n### Training\nI'm currently in the midst of training for the Manchester Marathon, so a lot of my training efforts have been focused on long-distance endurance. However that training has also had a huge impact on my short-distance times as well. I've had a number of 5k parkrun PBs over this winter, and I'm looking to go sub-22 this spring. Overall I'm feeling very positive about my health and in my late 30s I'm currently the fasest I've ever been. This was also my first 10k event of the year, having been forced to miss the Winchester 10k in February due to illness, and likewise this was my first visit to Eastleigh in two years as I was also ill for last year's event.\n\n### Pre-race\nDespite the start line only being a few miles from my house, I currently don't drive so it was an early start to get the bus and train. Arriving at the Places Leisure Centre just before half 7, I collected my bib and went to a coffee shop up the road for a nice sugary breakfast of a Blueberry muffin and a coffee. I find that a bit of caffeine and easily-digestable sugars help me for shorter distances where I don't need to take any more fuel onboard mid-race. Otherwise I just kept relaxed and ran over the strategy in my head once again.\n\nI saw a few familiar faces from my running club and had a chat, but otherwise I kept myself to myself before the start. The weather was rapidly warming up though, so I took off the extra layer I was wearing. Other than that, it was just a standard pre-race wait.\n\n### Race\nMy target was 48:00, so I placed myself a little bit in front of the 50 minute marker. The start was about the same organised chaos that you get with a single-wave mass start, with some traffic islands to avoid in the first few hundred metres. After that I was able to settle into a rhythm with consistent splits of 4:35, 4:36 and 4:38 respectively. At the time I thought I was maybe going a little fast, but I was going to largely judge things based on the outcome of my main tactic.\n\nAt 3.5km the only significant hill of the course arrived, Allbrook Hill. A 17m gain over 400 metres, this is by no means a tough one but still merited a slight slowdown. However after the up comes the down, a slightly longer 600m stretch to drop those 17 metres once again. Here is where my plan kicked in, as the only major downhill on the course I\u2019d push hard during this fifth kilometre and see how I feel for the second half. I was aiming for sub-4:20 here and got 4:15.\n\nThe second half of the course is virtually pancake flat, with a few minor rises and falls. My average pace was rapidly approaching 4:30/km, so I decided to stick with it in the hopes of getting close to 45 minutes. I already had nearly two minutes in the bank for a PB, so as long as I didn\u2019t blow out then this would be a very successful morning.\n\nKilometres 7, 8 and 9 ticked by at around 4:30/km, and going into the final kilometre I had enough in the tank to push on a little more. The PB was guaranteed, sub-48 was guaranteed, sub-46 was very likely and there was still the outside chance of sub-45. Entering Fleming Park I was looking up trying to judge how far away the finish line was, but knew quickly that sub-45 would be a stretch too far today. I managed to keep pace with a slightly younger woman for most of that home straight, though she left me for dust with a strong burst in the final 200m.\n\nI crossed the line in 45:22, finisher #499, and a new PB by a huge 3 minutes and 47 seconds. I\u2019d also set a PB of 49:19 here two years ago and promptly collapsed after the line, this time I stayed on my feet and I feel that sub-45 would have been achievable in hindsight with a slightly less cautious start.\n\n### Post-race\nI was oddly a lot more calm and collected than I was two years ago. Back then I had ended up reducing my year-on-year time from 1 hour 6 minutes to just 49, and that improvement had genuinely caught me by surprise (I ended up winning the award for best year-on-year improver). I\u2019m not eligible for that prize this year having missed 2024\u2019s edition through illness, and my PB this year felt more like an inevitability even if the degree of improvement was more surprising. Even so, bringing sub-45 right into view is a huge confident boost with a half-marathon coming up next weekend and the Manchester Marathon in a month.\n\nIf you live along the south coast of England and the 10k is your favourite distance, I can\u2019t recommend this event highly enough. No wonder it\u2019s been going strong for 40 years.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n",

I\u2019ll run 5Ks and other fun runs a couple times a year. I coach XC at a middle school as well. In 2005, when I was 20, I ran the San Diego Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Marathon. I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing for training then, so my main goal was to finish. Last year, my wife and I decided to run a 5K race (or more) once a month to usher in our 40th year so we did 12+ races last year. Because of this race challenge, I started to get back into racing, and wanted to finish my 40th birthday with a marathon. I had been eying the LA Marathon because I thought it would be an energetic race and a good way to get to So Cal for a vacation. \n\n\n\n### Training\n\nI already had a decent base, so my main goal for training was to ramp up miles over time and increase my speed over those miles. I set up a plan from random internet research and my own knowledge.(I think next marathon I might look into a specific training regiment.) I also needed a lot of flexibility in my plan since I was balancing work, 2 small kids, winter weather, cold/flu season and a few trips planned during training. Weekends would be set for my main, big run for the week. I\u2019d get speed workouts in with fartleks and tempo runs during my weekly runs after work. I tried out the Yasso 800 method to help get in a consistent speed/pace workout. (Basically, I converted my original marathon goal time of 3 hours 45 mins into 3 mins 45 seconds. I ran that time in intervals around an 800 meter course in a nearby park. The idea is to run each 800 at that pace building up to 10 laps towards the end of the training. It was a decent workout. The theory is that consistently running this workout will help you reach your goal time for the marathon. I guess it worked for me\u2026) The biggest challenge during my training was dealing with a cold in January and trying to run a 19 miler the day I started to feel remotely better. I struggled all 19 miles and I should\u2019ve rested up instead. But overall during training, I was doing better than expected with my pacing and speed. My Garmin predicted that I\u2019d run a 3:20 so I think that inflated my ego. \n\n\n\n### Pre-race\n\nMy family and I got an AirBnB near Dodger Stadium in Echo Park. Cute neighborhood and super convenient for the race Expo and start. The day we arrived to LA it was cold and rainy but we managed to get to the Expo at the stadium and pick up my bib, etc. The next 2 days I carbo loaded with every meal. Some good spots included In n Out, La Pergoletta in Los Feliz, Bay City Deli in Santa Monica and Pitfire Pizza in Echo Park. \n\nThe morning of the race I woke up at 4 am, had toast with peanut butter and banana and had my coffee to get things rolling. I applied body glide and packed up my GUs, water bottle with  Tailwind electrolytes, and running belt, and headed to the stadium on a Lime scooter at 5 am. \n\nThe stadium traffic looked very busy so I was glad I took a scooter over and stayed near the start. I was starting in the open coral since I didn\u2019t have a qualifying marathon time for the seeded corals. I made my way to the front of the corral around 6ish. The crowd wasn\u2019t too bad but by the time the race started it was jammed packed. Lots of antsy but fun energy waiting for the race!\n\n\n\n### Race\n\nMile 1-5: At the start, the open coral was released about 7 or 8 mins after the 7 am start, after all the seeded corrals were racing. Instantly, I had to pee badly so I peeled off to some bushes in Dodger Stadium. Another runner joined me. 30 seconds later I was off again. Leaving the stadium area is a long sloping hill down Sunset Blvd. I knew I was going to take this faster than my average goal pace (7:45-8 mins) to bank some time as long as my heart rate stayed in zone 2 (140s). After hitting Chinatown at the bottom of the hill, the course flattens out for a mile or so but my heart rate jumped to the high 150s (approaching my LTHR) which I knew was going to be a problem for my 40-year-old self. I think it spiked from the adrenaline because I tried to slow down my pace as I ran through DTLA to get my HR under control but I think I was just too excited. It stayed in the high 150s, spiking into the 160s for most of the race. The hill at mile 4 (Disney Concert Hall) was not as bad as I had read about online. The hill after, near mile 5, was tougher. \n\nMile 6-15: Coming into Echo Park and getting onto Sunset Blvd, the crowds start building up and I really enjoyed the rolling hills with views of the Hollywood sign. Also I ran by my cheer squad (my wife, kids and parents). The people brunching at the cafes on the sideline watching the race were a pleasant surprise (great way to spend a Sunday morning). I found my pace at 7:41 as I ran through Hollywood, but as I tried to speed up coming to the halfway mark, there\u2019s a slight grade approaching the Chateau Marmont and the Sunset Strip. That\u2019s when I felt like I was starting to lose some momentum and my HR was staying in the low 160s. The Sunset Strip is a rolling downhill area so I was betting on it helping mellow out my HR and getting back on track with my pace, especially with the big downhill at San Vicente Blvd. At this point I saw my family a 2nd time (They said they barely made it from the last watch spot because the traffic and parking was so crazy.)\n\nMile 16-18: Coming into Beverly Hills, I started to fade again. I really felt the false flat on Burton Way. On Rodeo Drive, the 3:30 pace group from the open coral caught up with me. I tried to stick with them but it just felt like we were bumping elbows, and I slowly fell behind by the time I turned onto Santa Monica Blvd. \n\nMile 19-22: The crowds were great coming into Century City\u2014definitely the most energized and biggest crowds of the race. I think I even saw the winner of the LA Marathon finishing up his race on the opposite side of Santa Monica at mile 26 as I passed mile 19. Running past the finish line and knowing I still had 8ish miles left, especially as I was bonking, was tough psychologically and the rolling hills on Santa Monica and the hill on Sepulvida really did me in. My pace slowed way down! At least my HR did too! It was tough to slow down and have people that I\u2019d passed earlier pass me. Also the area on Wilshire Blvd, around the 405 underpass, is a bleak, sparse area compared to the rest of the race. At the corner of Wilshire and San Vicente, I was tempted to take a beer shot from the group passing them out for St. Patty\u2019s Day\u2014maybe it would\u2019ve helped numb the pain\u2014but I pressed forward. When I finally made it to the turn around at Bundy Drive, I had a sigh of relief. \n\nMile 23-End: I was able to use the downhill at Sepulvida to help me \u201cspeed up\u201d during the final 5K, but it felt like the slowest 5K of my life. I kept telling myself that I was not going to walk, as I passed many runners walking by this point. My family saw me one last time at mile 25. My wife could tell from my face that I was in pain. The rolling hills on this part on Santa Monica really hurt, but I tried to push my pace up oh so much. Despite the energy of the crowds and knowing I was almost done, that final hill into the finish line was brutal. Nevertheless, I finished the marathon with a smile, got my metal and collected every snack, water and \u201cre-energizer\u201d I was handed. \n\n\n### Post-race\n\nThe finish line area is pretty long but it gave me time to take  a seat,  have a snack and milk carton. Apparently my phone had butt dialed a few people and eventually locked so that I couldn\u2019t unlock it for 1 hour 45 mins after I finished the race. I asked someone if I could text my wife to meet me at the beer garden in the mall atrium (most convenient and least crowded spot for a meet up in Century City). Getting the gear from gear check and squeezing my way through the crowded exit, where everyone had decided to meet their runner, took a long while. I was side tracked by the massage tables\u2014so worth it\u2014before I eventually found my wife at the beer garden.\n\nPost race, I was sore but not horrible after walking off the post race legs, and I wasn\u2019t all that hungry until later in the evening. The traffic was pretty bad getting out of Century City, even though my family parked in the neighborhoods west of Beverly Glen.\n\nI\u2019m already eyeing my next marathon. Originally thought I wouldn\u2019t do one until 2026, but I might sign up for one in October\u2026",

A friend convinced me and two others from our run club to run it together a month ago, so I've had good time to prepare. Since the beginning of 2025, I've decided to really ramp up mileage, mostly on a whim and partially because I have this goal of building up to 100 MPW. Suffice it to say this goal is HARD, and I've been lucky to average 60ish MPW. But because I had the month notice, I came into this race with a little bit of a taper, doing two lower volume weeks leading up to the race.\n\nOne wrench thrown into the mix of the taper: a 5K that I was already committed to, unfortunately set for the day before my 20 mile race. Because I had a bit of a local rivalry against another runner (only in my head \u2013 he\u2019s actually much faster than me) I intended to show up for, I had decided to run both races full out. In short, my 5k did not go well. My rival crushed me, I ran 35 seconds above my intended goal of sub-20, and my minute positive split of 6:05, 6:30, 6:59 pretty much summed up the race. Which is to say: PAIN. I'm pretty new to races, so my apparently nonexistent sense of pacing, especially for shorter distances, really shone here.\n\nGiven this 5k performance I'll admit I had quite a lot of doubts coming into the race. I really thought at this point I was a sub-20 5k kind of a runner, but having given it my absolute all, dying at the end, only for a sloppy-ass 20:33 (rightfully) knocked my inflated ego down a peg.\n\nOn the day one of my three friends was shooting for even splits of 7:30 throughout the race, and another was shooting for negative splits to hit an average of 7:00. My plan was to stay right behind 7:30 friend for most of the race before ideally starting a slow kick around mile 15.\n\n### Pre-Race\nThe buses were slated to leave at 8:45am from the parking lot for a 11am gun, which meant generously, at least 1.5 hrs of waiting at the start -- not super appreciated by our crew given it was another 1.5 hours to drive to the parking lot in the first place. Of course when we get there its a two lane road with hundreds of drivers on it, so there was inevitable traffic meaning inevitable bus delays meaning nowhere near a 8:45 last bus departure time. In the end, I didn't mind it too much, since at the starting line there was a school we could go inside of to stay warm and sit. Apparently they didn't give access to the school last year, which I could definitely anticipate being frustrating.\n\nI guess the other huge benefit of being at the start line for so long is that I could go to the bathroom multiple times. 4, to be exact. As they say, third time\u2019s the charm, and it was for me -- after that trip I knew immediately I had shaved at least 10 minutes off my time :).\n\nProbably should have gotten a little longer of a warm up in, but I settled for a 10minute jog and called it a day. Didn't have any breakfast, but did have a stick of Clif energy Bloks, along with some zero cal gatorade. Nutrition was actually on point the entire race. In previous marathons, I've done gels which are annoying to open and always get my hands all sticky/gross, but for the day I had a small bag of skratch sour gummies that I would periodically pop one of into my mouth. This worked like a charm, and I'll be definitely trying this again in future races.\n\n### Race\nHead-Windy. Foggy. Long stretches of Coastal gloom. But also the perfect temperature --low 50s-- and along with the fog, a whole race blessed with uninterrupted cloud cover. I'd take the last two over the first three any day, so for me, race conditions were pretty great. A cool thing about the fog was that every now and then you'd run into a section where the fog lifted, and for that section I felt a huge mental boost, as if my mind was suddenly shaken awake. Those periodic moments of mental clarity were greatly appreciated and quite motivating. \n\nAnyways, right as the race started plans of tailing my 7:30 friend were thrown out the window. He started fast, with a 7:15 first mile, and I felt good and followed for all of maybe a kilometer before passing him near the end of a 7:05 mile 1. From then on I had my sights set on my other buddy, who was planning on negative splitting to average 7:00s. I locked in behind him for the first few miles, before he started to widen the gap mid-race. \n\nAt this point, I am acutely aware of two things: \n1. At low 7:00s I\u2019m kind of a speedy mofo right now, especially given yesterday\u2019s 5k \nending with a third mile split of 6:59. (blehh \u2026)\n2. I feel good. Or rather \u2026 ok. Like I might just have the ability to stick this out for the rest \nof the race\nStarting from mile 7 or 8, around when the course moves out of the town of Kittery and into the actual (high-winds) seacoast, I become aware of another thing. Someone is drafting behind me! I speed up a little, and the footsteps get faster along with mine. I slow down, they slow down too. You know what? Fair fucking play. I\u2019ll admit later on in the race it took me a bit longer than it should\u2019ve for me to pass others too. It\u2019s windy out there, and players got to play. \n\nThis stretch of seacoast, around miles 7 to 16, moves fast but starts feeling a bit tougher as we run along. It\u2019s basically flat, but there are a few stretches of just the slightest uphill whisper, and those gradients begin to feel a bit more noticeable. \n\nSometimes in training, and generally, in running, I like to think about the squeeze. I come from a background of competitive chess, and there are positions which require you to slowly squeeze the opponent, to apply pressure ever so slightly and surely, and slowly, before they finally cave and crumble from the weight of all the impending pressure. The positional bind just becomes too strong. In this section of miles 7-16, I like to think Eastern States was starting the squeeze on me. \n\nAnd if we continue the analogy, Mile 17 is when I start to feel the bind. Mile 17 is TOUGH. Legs are getting heavy, the person in front of me is getting a little farther away, and every little anthill begins to feel like the end of a brutal hill workout. And then if mile 17 is tough, mile 18 is PAIN. We\u2019ve arrived into Portsmouth now, which means that the two-lane highway besides us has become a sprawling 4 lanes. What\u2019s worse is the imperceptible grade, coupled with emboldened headwinds. My cadence decreases, not for lack of trying, and with every turn my legs feel like they\u2019re being dragged out of mud. It\u2019s at this point that I seriously contemplate stopping and walking the rest. It\u2019s been a good race after all. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get this far anyways. A sandbagging group of runners pass me, doubling down on my feeling of despair. \n\nWhat keeps me going is the runner in front of me that also gets passed \u2013 someone I haven\u2019t seen before. A beacon of light in an otherwise gloomy world. I realize that I must be going faster than her, since it seems like I am barely inching closer. She\u2019s just within the perfect realm of doubt on whether I can catch up to her in the last mile and a half, and I commit myself to at least matching her cadence. \n\nMiles 18.5-19.5 are passed in this way, but it still feels BAD. Like my body is ready to STOP. Like actually, it\u2019s been ready to stop 30 minutes ago. But nevertheless, I have gained some ground on the runner ahead of me.  With .25 to go, I prepare for the all out kick. I think I pass her at 19.85, but by then passing her is already a foregone conclusion. I lock in to the runner after, next in line in striking distance, and sprint as fast as I can, which to be honest, is not that fast right now. Still, I edge him out right at the finish line. A picture perfect finish. \ud83d\ude0a \n\n### Post-race\n\n2:23:33. Holy moly. I am SPEED (or, rather, speed\u2019s underdeveloped toenail). I am also, GASSED. I stumble up to my friend who has finished more than two minutes ahead of me, mumble something incoherent, and make a beeline for the snack table where I proceed to down three vitamin waters, two bags of Pirate\u2019s Booty, and 2 yogurt sticks. For the next 10 minutes I walk around in a daze, resisting the immediate urge to drop to the floor and have my legs completely give out under me. The post-race cold settles in, \nAfter everyone\u2019s finished, we head to a brewery nearby and get some well-deserved (and tasty) grub. An excellent finish to an excellenter day. \n\n### Final thoughts\n\nMan, racing is awesome. Especially when you pass people. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, not too long ago I actively avoided racing. It just felt like a big fuss over nothing, and something that I had to pay for on top of. Running for me was something I did purely for the love of the activity itself, a tool for maintaining my health, for keeping me sane in an otherwise monotonous world. \n\nI still love running, and I will never stop appreciating running for, at the least, nothing more than the pure love of the run. But now I\u2019ve come to appreciate the specific joy of getting faster too. There is just something about racing that can bring out the best of you \u2013 something which I just cannot simulate while running on my own. It\u2019s crazy to think that three years ago I could barely string together 10 minutes of continuous running at 8:30 pace, and that now I can freaking finish 20 miles at 7:09. What a strange, but wonderful world we live in. \n\nI recently started a youtube channel, and made a video recap of my race!    \nhttps://youtu.be/yU5nmDeyGps\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/) created by /u/herumph.\n",
