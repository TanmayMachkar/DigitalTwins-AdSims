    "selftext": "# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!\n\nr/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.\n\nTo help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.\n\n# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded.\n\nDomain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it free and accessible to all despite any site changes, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.\n\n# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!\n\n* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.\n* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.\n* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.\n* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by \"it depends.\"  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.\n\n# The Rules\n\n[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)\n\nr/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.  When making a post or comment, you are expected to understand and abide by our rules.  Make sure to review [Rule #0 - No Threads That Are Answered by the Wiki, Searching Threads, or Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule0) and [Rule #5 - No Questions Related to Injury, Pain, or Any Medical Topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule5) as these are the two most commonly broken rules by new users.\n\n# Weekly Threads\n\nr/Fitness has some regularly posted, themed threads that you can see the schedule for below.

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.\n\nSo phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate.

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

From the introductory paragraph:\n\n>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume \u201c1.6-2.2g/kg\u201d [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don\u2019t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you\u2019ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume \u2013 it certainly won\u2019t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn\u2019t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.\n\nThis article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition.",

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

    "title": "2,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day",
    "selftext": "This is another update about training without rest days. I have surpassed 2,000 consecutive training days. Along the way I have grown bigger, stronger, and generally more fit. This is because training without rest days requires sustainability above all else. To accomplish that, my priorities as a lifter have shifted to consistency, patience, and effort. These are what I have previously referred to as \u201c[the triumvirate of progress](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/).\u201d Those three priorities govern sustainable progress, meaning gains.\n\n**What this post is not\u2026**\n\n\u2026 me saying that rest days are wholly or even generally unwarranted.\n\n\u2026 me saying that rest days are bad, suboptimal, unscientific, etc.\n\n\u2026 me making a moral or ethical argument about rest days themselves.\n\n\u2026 me trying to make you feel bad for taking rest days. \u00a0\n\n**This post is\u2026**\n\n\u2026 an anecdote about training without rest days and how daily training has benefitted me.\n\n**Stats**\n\nAge: 38.7\n\nGender: Man(let)\n\nWeight: 210\n\nHeight: LOL\n\nLifts: Squat [525](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0KGr8rAkAY/?img_index=1), Bench [340](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSzsrhgtCx/), Dead [600](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qKfzxAq9K/) (best ever was 635), Press [250](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw7oYDAwKT/?img_index=2).\n\nNatty Status: I was on TRT nearly a decade ago. Tried it for a year. Didn\u2019t benefit from it like I thought I would based on what I was told at the time. Nothing during this period. I have not and do not claim to be a \u201clifetime natural.\u201d\n\n**Why I decided to start training daily (and heaps of other detailed information)**\n\nThat and more can be read in my previous posts:\n\n[Five Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bob6rg/five_years_without_a_rest_day/)\n\n[The Tom Platz Experience: Pain, pleasure, and high rep squats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/)\n\n[Four Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12lgk9f/four_years_without_a_rest_day/)\n\n[No Rest Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yaw8qa/no_rest_days/)\n\n[1,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sb7tbh/1000_workouts_without_a_rest_day/)\n\n**Training without rest days has benefited me because:**\n\n**-** By prioritizing sustainability over all else, I make better training decisions. This results in fewer injuries and minor setbacks, meaning more gains with less risk.\n\n**-** [Lifting is something I enjoy, so I do it often and feel better because of it.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html)\n\n**-** Frequency is a significant factor in making progress, whether that is gaining size or strength. I am now bigger than I\u2019ve ever been and stronger in nearly every lift.\n\n**-** My general fitness has improved due to the increased training frequency allowing for more training diversity. Meaning more opportunities to include conditioning workouts whereas previously nearly all my workouts were strength oriented because \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to do conditioning\u201d consistently (an excuse).\n\nYou might benefit similarly if you decide to train without rest days. You might not. All I can say definitively is that I am happy with my results and because training is itself a luxury and a pleasurable experience, I will continue to do it daily.\n\nCounterintuitively, busier people seem to do better with daily training. This is because a three-, four-, or five-day training week (as is typical) packs in exercises and a progression that can take an hour or more to complete. Busy people often do not have that kind of time. I have found that my busy clients can manage 30 to 45 minutes consistently and sometimes even less than that. So, to accomplish their goals they have started training daily, with each workout being shorter, biasing the program towards consistency, which ushers results when coupled with patience, effort, and of course sensible exercise selection, volume, and intensity progression.\n\nWhile most of my training has been based on my [General Gainz training framework](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/), there are occasions when my progress is not derived from General Gainz, or even my own [original training structure](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) (modeled after a pyramid). These resources will provide to you a reasonable structure with which you can build your own training programs. Even brief ones, so that you can also begin training daily (if it is right for you; some may have contraindications).\n\nThere are two things that have recently benefitted my training. The first was when I ran a program called Maelstrom which resulted in a lifetime personal record [600-pound beltless deadlift](https://youtu.be/q0_bACQ8MvI?si=YjLVb1mWvqcaiBps). Here is [a review another user wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1cy1oq2/upcoming_program_review_gzcl_maelstrom_for/) of their experience running that program. This was a very unusual approach to training the deadlift because it is high frequency, high volume, and low intensity.\n\nThe second occasion was when I had only a brief period to get a training session in. This happens somewhat regularly now because I own my own business. To train effectively in a short period of time I would do workouts that I began to call Monotony. These helped me maintain the daily training streak because even if I had only 15 minutes in my schedule, I could still hammer a lift and benefit from the workout. Perhaps you would likewise benefit.\n\nYou can read [Maelstrom & Monotony](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2024/10/2000-days-maelstrom-monotony.html) and watch me perform those workouts on my blog and Instagram. On my blog you will have access to an updated program compendium, so that way you can perhaps run one of my old programs like GZCLP, Jacked & Tan 2.0, or try drowning in deadlifts by running Maelstrom.\n\nI wish you the best with your training. If you have any questions, drop them in the comments and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.",

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

    "title": "42 Male Cancer Survivor 8 Months Progress ",
    "selftext": "Start: 190lbs 8 Months: 154lbs\n\nAround 3 Years ago in the summer of 21 I was diagnosed with stage 4b rectal cancer. I was 39.\n\nUnderwent 2 years of treatment which included radiation, chemo and 4 Surgeries. I had my 4th and hopefully final surgery in Sep of 23, I am currently in remission.\n\nI used to workout in my 20's but lost track of my fitness and allowed myself to reach 36 waist size.\n\n  \n**Progress Pics:**\n\nI don't know why i took this pic but this is me post covid, i probably weighed like 220+ at this stage\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk](https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk)\n\nThis is me in Feb of 24 - [https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1](https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1)\n\nThis Pic is from July 6th - [https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX](https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX)\n\nI just wanted to help my body heal and repair the damage from the 2 years of treatment and made a commitment to myself to try and do some workout and hopefully make it a habit.\n\n**Diet:**\n\n**Dec - Feb:** The most important change was my diet, I was asked by my surgeon to start taking a high protein and as low carbs as you can diet to try and combat some post radiation issues in my GI tract.\n\nI did intermittent fasting for 16 hours from 7pm - 11am\n\nFirst Meal - Chicken/Fish , Saut\u00e9 vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit\n\nSecond Meal - Greek Yogurt With Handful of Almonds, 2 Ripe Banana's\n\nThird Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, 2 Slice Sourdough Bread\n\n\n\n**Feb - Current** : I stopped doing intermittent fasting and added a whey isolate protein shake. I target to eat my third meal before 7:30 pm each night\n\nRight After Workout - Whey Isolate Protein Shake, Overnight Soaked Almonds\n\nFirst Meal - 2 Whole Boiled Eggs, 2 Whole Boiled Egg white only, Greek Yogurt/Cottage Cheese\n\nSecond Meal - Chicken/Fish , Saut\u00e9 vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit\n\nAround 3-4pm - Whey Isolate Protein Shake\n\nThird Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, half cup or full cup of wild/brown rice.\n\n**Exercise Routine:** \n\nI started with r/bodyweightfitness  minimal routine and a self made warmup routine in the third week of Dec 23. Following was the routine\n\nWarm-up\n\nAll of these were done for 30sec - 1 min\n\nSeiza\n\nDeep Squat And Hold\n\nBear Walk\n\nCrab\n\nHorse Stance\n\nDead Hang\n\nMinimal Routine\n\nI did this like a circuit on an average i did 4 per day\n\nPush Up\n\nSquat(bodyweight)\n\nLow Row(Two Bedsheets in a door)\n\nPlank\n\nJumping jacks\n\nI did this routine with a goal to be able to do 10 push ups 20 squats 10 low row 1 minute plank 35 jumping jacks.\n\nAround Feb of 24 I started noticing some changes in day to day energy levels and it just felt good and my post radiation issues were also easing down.\n\nI was not able to go to gym yet since i was still dealing with a lot of post treatment issues and i wanted to be able to challenge myself without needing to buy weights as I live in an appt.\n\nDid some research and bought a cheap squat rack from amazon and a pair of gymnastics rings, parallettes, a set of resistance bands. The squat rack was for hanging the rings and getting a bar to do pull ups.\n\nI went with a modified version of the beginner routine from r/bodyweightfitness wiki the warmup routine remained the same except i removed the dead hang.\n\nAll Pairs in Supersets with a 90 sec rest in the pair and 60 sec rest for the core superset pairs.\n\n3 sets - rep number changed throughout, the below numbers are what i am doing currently\n\nPull Up - 5\n\nSquats(Bands) - 10\n\n\n\nRing Dips - 8\n\nRing Hamstring curls - 15\n\n\n\nRing Inverted Rows - 8\n\nDecline Push Up(parallettes) - 10\n\n\n\nCore Superset\n\nHanging Knee Raises - 10\n\nPalof Press - 10 each side\n\nSuperman - 10\n\n\n\nI now have access to a gym and was wondering what would be a good program to start my goal is to build strength and get down to 14-18 % body fat range.\n\nI was looking at the 5/3/1 for beginner and liked this following routine\n\nDay 1:\n\n\u2013 Superset Bench with: DB Row, Planks\n\n\u2013 Superset Squat with: DB OHP, BW Bulgarian Split Squat\n\nDay 2:\n\n\u2013 Supserset OHP with: DB Curls, Paloff Press with Band\n\n\u2013 Superset DL with: Pushups, DB Lunges\n\nDay 3:\n\n\u2013 Superset Squat with: DB Rows, DB Swings\n\n\u2013 Superset Bench with: DB Lateral Raises, Leg Raises (on bench)\n\na set of  main lift, a set of both accessories, then rest 90s.\n\nI plan to swim for 30 mins on rest days\n\nThanks for going through the post, I hope you can find something useful here to start your own journey.",

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on.

An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.\n\nSo phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",

    "title": "Ultrarunning and Strength Training - Racing 100 miles while Benching 405+ & Deadlifting 600+ - My take on \"Hybrid Training\", and how to get started if you want to lift heavy AND run extreme distances.",
    "selftext": "It used to be, that there were strength athletes, and then there were endurance athletes. With very little overlap in disciplines. Obviously, there were people in sports doing both, but they generally specialized in one, and only dabbled in the other sporadically. \n\nThese days social media is absolutely inundated with *\u201cHybrid athletes\u201d;* men and women who see themselves, not just as a runner, or cyclist, or powerlifter, or bodybuilder, but as a combination of 2+, wildly incongruent, disciplines.\n\nThese *\u201cHybrid Athletes\u201d* often fill their social media with messages about how you can become strong, and fast, and that you do not have to choose between one or the other, as long as you *\u201cJust buy their program and products!\u201d* \n\nWell today, I would like to share some of my thoughts on *\u201c*hybrid training*\u201d.* But before we get into the thick of it, a quick TLDR for those of you not interested in reading the whole post is below.\n\n***TLDR:*** ***\u201cHybrid Training\u201d*** **isn\u2019t going to make you an elite athlete. You likely won\u2019t be setting any records in either of your chosen sports if you go this route. You might get quite good at one, and proficient at the other, or if you are very gifted, maybe you will get really good at both, but you will never be ELITE;** ***(setting national+ records in both sports simultaneously),*** **at two sports that require incredibly different training methodologies and favor opposing body types. The online influencers and** ***\u201ccoaches\u201d*** **do not have a magic formula to get you fast and jacked. The truth is that** ***\"hybrid training\"*** ***WILL*** **give you worse results than focusing on one sport, however, the variety can be very rewarding. How you go about this is all very simple, it\u2019s just also incredibly time consuming.**\n\n(note: I really hate the term \u201c**hybrid athlete**\u201d and do not consider myself to be an \"athlete\" at all, I am just a working father and husband that enjoys running and lifting. So from this point on in the post, I will be avoiding it)\n\n---\n\n#**Who am I? (i.e. \u201ccredentials\u201d)**\n\nSome of you may recognize me from previous posts, such as:\n\n\u00b7 **OVERTRAINED: Deadlift** \u2013 Where [I deadlifted 605+ every day for 50 days, ending in a 765lb 1rm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/s/qpgVJVl6Jb)\n\nOr\n\n\u00b7 **OVERTRAINED: Bench** \u2013 Where [I Benched 345+ every day for 50 days, ending in a 465lb 1rm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/s/vTeEmUufnR)\n\nI have also created and shared a few popular programs over the years, which have helped many of you on your strength goals.\n\nMore recently, I ran 100 miles through the rain and mud, at the Rocky Raccoon 100, in Huntsville Texas. A race that saw over half the field drop out due to the horrible trail conditions. Despite the rain, flooded trails, mud, and slop, which resulted in macerated feet, blisters, and losing toenails, I pushed through and made it to the end.\n\nThen, just 3 days later\u2026 I [loaded up 4 plates on the bar, and hit a 405 lb bench press](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/s/dFt3M7E7dh). A combination of achievements that has rarely *(*if ever?*)* before been achieved.\n\nI spent the subsequent 10 weeks following the race hitting consistent 70-100+ mile weeks, while lifting 2-3x per week, leading up to this friday, where I [Deadlifted 617 pounds, and then immediately began a 63 mile run through the night](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/s/ZW5Xl5Snpz) another fun mix of heavy lifting and long distance, this time, done as a solo event with my 3 year old Australian Shepherd.\n\n***A bit more background & some Notable PR\u2019s***\n\nI started ice-skating at just 3 years old, played hockey, baseball, football, worked on a farm, hunted, and was generally extremely active throughout my entire childhood. At the age of 12 I began lifting in the gym with my dad, and he taught me all the basics of barbell training. I also stayed involved in sports, and competed as a varsity athlete until going off to college. I am a registered professional engineer, and own/operate a business, while raising a young family of 3 children with my wife, who I have been with for nearly 18 years. After 20+ total years of training, I reached my peak lifting numbers in 2021, when I competed in a powerlifting meet, and set the deadlift record for my state, with a 716lb lift. After the competition I made a drastic shift over to running as my main priority, and signed up for my first ultramarathon. A 50 kilometer trail race in central Minnesota. \n\n\nI set all my Personal Records in lifting and running between September 2021 and the present day, a period of 2.5 years. Those PR\u2019s were:\n\n\u00b7 606 squat\n\n\u00b7 465 bench\n\n\u00b7 765 sumo deadlift / 700 conventional / 716 State Record Deadlift.\n\n\u00b7 5:10 Mile\n\n\u00b7 18:34 5k\n\n\u00b7 3:18 Marathon\n\n\u00b7 Completed at least a marathon and/or an ultramarathon every month for going on 2+ years, with distances up to 100 miles.\n\nAll of these can be found in my extensive post history here on reddit.\n\n---\n\nSo, after that first 50k trail ultramarathon, I was hooked. I signed up for a 100k, and started running 50-100+ mile weeks.\n\nIn 2023 I logged 3465 miles, with long runs extending beyond the marathon distance of 26.2 miles, up to 50+ miles, at least once per month. Some were sanctioned races, some were solo adventures, but they all pushed me closer to my goal, Running 100 miles at the Rocky Raccoon 100, in February 2024, which I finished just 12 weeks ago.\n\nRocky Raccoon was an incredibly difficult race, primarily due to the rain and mud, but it just fueled my desire for more, and I am already signed up for my next 100 miler, coming up in August of this year, with some solo ultra-adventures in between, and my first 200 miler in 2025.\n\nI am also back to lifting heavy, having squatted 445, benched 405, and deadlifted 635 in the weeks following the race.\n\nSo that\u2019s enough about me, lets get to the main point of this post.\n\n---\n\n***A little motivation: [\u201cHarder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Daft Punk\u201d](https://youtu.be/gAjR4\\_CbPpQ?si=TD5S9F3UuGVyhdww)***\n\nOver the last few years I have written quite a bit on reddit about how I go about my training, to be able to consistently finish ultramarathons, while maintaining enough strength to deadlift 600+ or bench 400+.\n\nIf you spend enough time in my post history, I am certain that you will find some very contradictory opinions on training philosophies, diet, recovery etc. This has all been a long learning process for me, as I have experimented and manipulated all the variables in my life to maximize performance in two sports that don\u2019t typically mix very well, all while leading a busy home and work life.\n\nSo lets discuss the logistics of training.\n\n\u00b7 How hard is it to train for an ultramarathon while maintaining enough strength to bench press over 405 pounds, or deadlift 600+? \n\n\u00b7 How hard should individual training sessions be to facilitate productive adaptations, without impacting recovery? \n\n\u00b7 How hard is it to stick to a diet that can support all of this training? \n\n\u00b7 How hard is it to coordinate all the training with a busy work and family life?\n\nWhen I talk about how \"hard\" something is, I want to clarify that this isn\u2019t a David Goggins style speech on \u201cStaying Hard\u201d. That isn\u2019t my style at all, there are days you will need to dial things back, and there are far more important things in my life than training. Instead, its just a straightforward discussion of the facts around training to run, and lift, at a decent level, and the difficulties one must deal with if they want to succeed. As always, family and work come first, but when those aspects are properly taken care of, its time to train.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n---\n\nThese days, training to reach the top in any activity requires an absolute focus and specialization. You don\u2019t become an elite 5k runner by improving your deadlift. You don\u2019t become a Chess grandmaster by spending time out on the driving range working on your tee shot, and you don\u2019t become an elite skier by playing video games. You need to put all of your free time and energy into your chosen sport/activity. This isn\u2019t any different for strength/endurance \u201c*hybrid*\u201d athletes looking to get faster and stronger. \n\nThe problem is, that is the essence of training for strength and endurance simultaneously. You are taking time away from one activity to train another, that has very little, if any, applicable carryover.\n\n***If you are just starting out, you can do both, and you can improve at both, and you can do so for a very long time. Most of the people in this subreddit will fall into this category, and should leave this post knowing that they can run and lift and make gains, and that they don\u2019t need to worry about [\u201cthe interference effect\u201d](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-interference-effect**)\n\n**Lift weights, do your cardio, and get better**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut for those of you striving for more, those of you who want to be the best of the best at what you do, eventually, one activity **MUST** give way for the other. \n\nI have fought this realization for the last 2-3 years, trying to maintain as much strength as possible while getting faster and building my endurance, but I have reached, at least my personal, genetic and time limitations. I can no longer keep pushing and building at both, and therefore I have decided to back off the heavy strength training, to make way for more running improvements. I am cutting weight, and knowingly getting weaker on the main lifts, but the tradeoff is clear. I\u2019m getting faster even at nearly 37 years old, and my ability to endure long distances has improved drastically.\n\nSo why does this happen? Why do we hit a point where we can no longer improve? Does running interfere with muscle gain that much? \n\nHonestly, while that is part of the equation, I do not believe that it is the main issue. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle when it comes to training for ultras and high level strength training?... **IS TIME.**\n\nLet\u2019s break down my week as an example: I am running a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week right now. I have been doing so for 10 consecutive weeks, since the Rocky Raccoon 100, and plan to continue doing so all year. I have hit multiple weeks of 80+, 90+, and even 100+ miles since then. This amount of running takes a lot of time.\n\nIf you average 8:00/mi, a 75 mile week takes 10 hours. At 10:00 mile, you are looking at over 12 hours. Throw in some trail runs and hiking in the mountains, and suddenly you could be looking at 15-16+ hours just for the running alone. \n\nNow you want to add in 40-50+ hours per week of work, plus commute time, 50-60+ hours per week of sleep, time for meals, time for chores and a multitude of additional life obligations, and still make time for your family, going to soccer practices and piano recitals, math club, and family game night\u2026 and the remaining time for going to the gym starts to really get slim.\n\nSo do you go get that additional 8 mile run in on a Saturday afternoon? Or do you try to deadlift on fatigued legs\u2026 or do you watch Bluey with your daughter? you must decide on your own, but no matter which choice you make, it comes at the expense of all the other things.\n\nBecause of this, my training schedule includes a LOT of doubles. \n\nI wake up early, while my wife and kids are still sleeping, and I run 5-10 miles.\n\nThen, later in the day, I either go to the gym during my lunch break, or I run again.\n\nMonday through Thursday, in just 4 days, I am generally logging 8 training sessions, but they are all on MY time, when they wont interfere with my family or work obligations.\n\nThese doubles, come at the cost of sleep, and  training instead of resting/recovering at lunch. I wake up at 4:00am, and I\u2019m busy until my head hits the pillow, after my kids are tucked in. For many people, this is not a sustainable choice to make. For me, I love it. It gives me structure and purpose outside of everyday life.\n\nOn that topic of fatigue, when you are pairing your lifting and running together, a major area of concern is going to be **how to structure your training**, so that it can be productive. I will go into this later in more detail, but its important to note, that for this type of training to work, you NEED to know how to take an easy day, while still getting work done. Note, I didn\u2019t say a REST day, I said an EASY day. There is a big difference, and with time limitations already being an issue, you need to train as often as you have time.\n\n**Another key aspect to fatigue management, is diet**. Everyone has their own opinions on diets, and some people are incredibly militant about them, so I am not going to spend too much time on it, but I will say this.\n\nCarbohydrates **WILL** improve your performance. Go ahead and be low carb/keto if that\u2019s what you want, but just know that you are adding an artificial handicap to your training.\n\n* If you aren\u2019t recovering between sessions: eat and sleep more. \n* If you are sore: eat and sleep more\n* If you are tired before a workout: you need to eat and sleep more\n\nFood fuels your training, and along with sleep, facilitates your recovery. If you are low on energy, you will not be productive in the gym or in your running.\n\nI use an app called \u201cMacrofactor\u201d to track my weight and caloric intake, and with my weekly mileage and lifting factored into things, I require a bit over 4,800 calories per day, just to maintain my bodyweight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n***So what does my training look like? What should your training look like?***\n\nComing off of the Rocky Raccoon 100 mile race, and training leading up to my next 100, I am aiming to run a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week, with most weeks closer to 80, and peak weeks exceeding 100 miles, while lifting at least 2 times per week.\n\n[On a day by day basis, that looks something like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qf\\_Fx3T1tDraqlgImbtd9q1vZd3eSgeA/edit?usp=drive\\_link&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\nMonday-Thursday all include doubles, with easy morning runs, and then lifting, or running again in the afternoon.\n\nFridays are recovery days, where I usually cycle, but also occasionally add more miles in with my wife or kids if they want to go for a run.\n\nSaturdays are long run days\n\nSundays are more open, to fill in missing mileage, lifting, or just resting if I have completed my goal weekly distance and lifting.\n\nIf you look closely at the Weekly Schedule, you will see that I am trying to **seperate hard efforts** **by as many hours as possible,** with the exception of Thursday, which has 2x hard efforts.\n\nThe reason for this separation needs explanation. \n\nWhen getting advice from a running coach, they will tell you to do your hard running workouts first, and any heavy lifting later that day, but to keep your hard days hard, and your easy days easy.\n\nWhen getting advice from a strength coach, they will tell you to do your hard lifting first, and any HIIT/interval work after, and once again, to keep your hard days hard, and your easy days easy.\n\nThe reason they suggest this, is because they care first and foremost about getting the maximum stimulus and adaptation from the first workout, when you are fresh and rested. The second workout is guaranteed to suffer. But you keep it on the same day, so that you allow enough rest time before the next hard effort of a primary workout. \n\nSo if you are a runner, you don\u2019t want to run hard Monday, squat hard Tuesday, and run hard Wednesday. That leaves very little time for recovery. And the same goes for someone only interested in strength training.\n\n**However!** If you care about improving both equally, this is a recipe for failure. Over the years, the solution I have come up with, is to reduce the VOLUME of hard efforts, but to do them on their own days. This way each individual session doesn\u2019t destroy you, it doesn\u2019t take as long to recover from, but you can do both types of training more often. \n\n---\n\nSo what does \u201creducing the volume of hard efforts\u201d look like? well, lets start with running for our example. Lets say you are running a marathon training program, we are going to look at the [Hal Higdon advanced Marathon 1](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/advanced-1-marathon) for our example.\n\n If you scroll down the page here, you will see the way he has set up your weekly running. On Thursdays he has speedwork. In week 3 he has 4x800m intervals scheduled. On week 6 this goes to 5x800, and by week 15 it has progressed all the way up to 8x800m intervals. That\u2019s 4 miles of hard efforts. That is going to have a big hit on recovery! If all you are doing is running and training for a marathon, that\u2019s going to be just fine. But you aren\u2019t just interested in running here. You are trying to run, and build strength in the gym. You want to run a marathon and squat 500 pounds. You want to complete an ultramarathon and still be able to rep 315 on the bench the next week. so that volume needs to be reduced. You don\u2019t need to run those intervals slower, you don\u2019t need to change the schedule, just do a fewer total number. Instead of 4x800 in week 3, and 8x800 in week 15, start with half the volume, and see how you adapt and recover. 2x800 thrown into a nice mid-distance run should be easy enough to recover from, and within a few weeks maybe you can build that up to 4-6x800m.\n\nThe same reduction in volume of hard efforts works for your lifting as well. Instead of hitting 5 sets of 3 at 85-90+% on your heavy day, maybe you are only hitting 1-2 sets, but you keep the intensity high. Work up to a top set or two, then move on, so that you can get the adaptations brought on by heavy lifting, without all the added fatigue of crushing yourself with set after set after set.\n\nThe tradeoff here is obviously that you will progress at both modalities slower. But one step forward on strength and endurance, is better than two steps forward on one, and one step back on the other.\n\n---\n\nThe other thing you will notice, is the sheer volume of easy running I am doing. My primary sport now is ultrarunning, and with that, I do not need to do a ton of fast intervals, in fact the interval work I do have included is probably too short for my goals. (it\u2019s a remnant from when I was working on my mile time)\n\nBut all those long easy runs build your base, and if you are beginner, they will also help you get faster.\n\nThis might be one of my more controversial opinions, but I think doing intervals/speedwork on a low mileage program (<20mpw) is a waste of time for most people that have a strength background, and they would be better served by adding mileage.\n\n---\n\n**So what are we getting at here, what is the point of this post?**\n\n1. You can get pretty good at both running and lifting, but you can't be truly elite at both simultaneously\n\n2. Cardio will help your lifting, and lifting will help your running\u2026 up to a point. There ARE diminishing returns, and eventually even a negative response when you get more advanced in each discipline.\n\n3. Try to separate your lifts and runs by as many hours as possible when you do them both on the same day\n\n4. Keep most of your mileage easy\n\n5. Do your hard runs and hard lifts on separate days if possible\n\n6. Do the harder workout first, follow up with the easier (hard run->easy lift, or hard lift->easy run)\n\n7. Increase mileage before worrying about pace.\n\n8. carbs are magical\n\n9. two 10ks will be easier to recover from than a single 20k, but they don't have quite the same training effect, so split up runs when needed, but try to get at least a few runs per week that are longer.\n\n10. finally, this is really unpopular to say these days, as everyone wants to tell you that you can be a runner and be fat/overweight at the same time, but the truth is, losing weight **WILL** help your running if you are overweight, and gaining weight **WILL** help your lifting if you are underweight, being lean at whatever weight you choose will help you perform best at both, so drop that bodyfat%\n\n---\n\nI could continue this for pages, but it has gone on long enough. So ask questions and I will try to answer them, or call me dumb for writing this ridiculously long post as an old man with \"mid-results\"\n\nI\u2019m here for it!",

    "selftext": "I could use some advice on a leg day routine for my cycling goals. Currently, I focus on hypertrophy while also aiming to prevent injuries and enhance muscular endurance for sprint cycling. \n\nMy typical leg day includes exercises like Romanian deadlifts, Bulgarian split squats (glute-focused), sissy squats, and hamstring curls. If I have extra time, I throw in single-leg RDLs, and cossack squats or side lunges to address balance and target the glute medius.\n\nSince I cycle a lot, and a past injury caused by muscular imbalance (specifically quad dominance/weak glutes, but also weaker left leg), I'm wondering if my leg day should differ from a purely hypertrophy-focused plan.\n\nMy main objectives remain hypertrophy, injury prevention, and muscular endurance. Since sprint cycling is kind of a high rep exercise, would incorporating higher reps, possibly up to 25 or 30, be beneficial for improving muscular endurance? Or would I still benefit from low/med rep ranges (5 to 10)?\nAdvice on exercises of my current routine is also welcome.\n\nAny insights or suggestions on rep range and other lifts/exercises would be greatly appreciated!",

But when I do them, my muscles are not my limiting factor. It is my breath. I am totally gased out after half the reps I want to do.\n\nAt the moment I am doing squats with 8 reps. Usually I am 90% out of breath after 4 repetitions and I am not even close to some kind of failure. Same with Deadlifts where I usually do 6 reps.\n\nWhat I am doing most of the time when doing squats is the following: Do 4 reps, rest in standing position for maybe 5 deep breaths, do 2 reps more, take 5 deep breaths again, do one rep, take 5-8 deep breaths, and then do the last rep.\n\nWhen I am doing it like this I get close to failure after the 8th rep. I am 100% out of breath after the last rep and probably everyone in the gym can hear me gasping for breath and I breathe heavy for maybe 2 minutes and still not rested at 3 minutes.\n\nIs this normal? Should you do squats like this? With deadlifts the same problem. Pullups und chestpress is 100% okay and no problem here.\n\nI do a lot of medium intensity cardio (cycling) and I don't have problem with endurance, generally.\n\nIf this is not normal, what is the best advice? I tried different rep ranges and the problem is present on most rep ranges unless I go super low to 1-3 reps with heavy weight.",

    "title": "Five Years Without a Rest Day",
    "selftext": "Hello, /u/gzcl here with another post about training without rest days. I recently crossed the five-year mark of training without rest days, so I figured it warranted an update.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12lgk9f/four_years_without_a_rest_day/) is the update from last year. Many other details about my training, including videos of PR lifts, can be found in my post history, Instagram, YouTube, and blog. Each is linked throughout this post.\n\nBefore we get into the post, I want to be clear that I am not saying that everyone should train without rest days, or that nobody needs them, or that I\u2019m better than anyone because I have not taken rest days, or that rest days are inherently useless or bad, or that not taking rest days always produce better results or training like this makes me a hard-core tough guy type. So, please, do not read into this post such contrivances.\n\nAgain, this post is not telling you that you absolutely do not need rest days, no matter what. This post is critical of rest days because it has been my experience that rest days are often taken for granted and are therefore abused; something which may inhibit training rather than aid it.\n\nNow, I would like to address some basic facts of who I am and what my situation is. These things will provide insight into why I chose to train without rest days, how I am able to do it, and why I am here encouraging you to consider whether rest days are necessary, based on your circumstances, abilities, and goals.\n\n**About me:**\r  \n**Age:** 38\r  \n**Years Training:** 15+\r  \n**Bodyweight:** 205 to 210, daily average. (Up from [158 on day 31](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) of training without rest days)\r  \n**Height:** 5\u20195\u201d\r  \n**Recent 1-Rep Maxes:** [525 squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0KGr8rAkAY/?img_index=1), [340 bench](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSzsrhgtCx/), [600 deadlift](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qKfzxAq9K/) (no belt), [250 strict press](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw7oYDAwKT/?img_index=2). \n\nAll these lifts were performed within the last year of training without rest days. The only lift that is not an all-time PR 1RM is the bench. That is because the bench press messes with my shoulder, a longstanding injury that I am always training around as best as I can; my lifetime 1RM bench PR is 380 pounds. While 635 pounds is my best deadlift, it was with a belt, so the above linked deadlift is a PR of significant variation.\n\n**Training Environment:** Home gym for the first three-ish years of training without rest days, then I opened my own gym. I train at very high elevation (over 10,000 feet) in a well-outfitted commercial facility.\n\n**Health:** No chronic illnesses or diseases. I very rarely get sick. In these five years there was only one time where I had very bad congestion. I still trained. I opted to do a conditioning workout of KB swings and push-ups. It was a great choice at the time because I felt much better the next day. The worst are migraines I get somewhat frequently. When this happens, I will just go lighter or change the plan of the day to doing arms, as those workouts are less stressful in general. If I am even feeling a bit under the weather, I train with reduced volume, intensity, or both, depending on the day and my assessment of where I am then standing recovery wise.\n\n**Injuries:** No serious recent injuries, mostly just training around or in consideration of preexisting injuries (sustained before training without rest days). This has limited the frequency of very heavy lifting, so I\u2019ve opted for more of a volume, and therefore, lighter weight approach in general. That said, I\u2019ve still hit 1RM personal records in these five years. I\u2019m just not lifting heavy each week because when I do I increase my chances of aggravating an old injury.\n\n**Drug Use:** No, I am not using steroids, testosterone, SARMS, or other such chemicals, peptides, hormones, etc. I do have low test and nearly a decade ago I tried TRT for a year. It did not help me. I do not claim to be a \u201clifetime natural.\u201d These five years of training without rest days was not benefitted by using such performance enhancements.\n\n**Diet:** Whatever my wife makes, or wherever we go out to eat (which is mostly Mexican food). I do not adhere to a strict diet. I eat a lot of breakfast burritos which have plenty of eggs and meat. Most of my diet is based around red meat, especially dinner. Lately, my household has been having a lot of hot pot, which is a copious amount of thin sliced meat, golden radishes, various noodles, and rice cakes. For the last five years I have been rotating different lengths of bulk and cut cycles. I have gained about 50 pounds in this period.\n\n**Supplements:** I try to take creatine and vitamin D consistently. Sometimes I miss days. Same goes for electrolytes. I may incorporate other supplements from time to time, such as fish oil, but have found much of that to have no clear benefit to performance. Not that I doubt those things. It just isn\u2019t a priority for me.\n\n**Sleep:** Average around 6 to 8 hours per night. Sometimes I get less, as I do suffer from sleepless nights occasionally. These may be just 2 to 4 hours of sleep. Still in such cases I will train, adjusting the goal of the session as needed. I do try to have a relatively strict bedtime.\n\n**Why do I train daily?**\n\n1. To see if I can.\n2. [Because I enjoy the process](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html) (despite some torturous individual sessions).\n3. It improves my mood and general outlook on life while at the same time [improving my quality of life by making everyday tasks easier](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/10/1300-days-process-is-goal.html) (shoveling snow in particular) by limiting the impact of old injuries.\n4. It keeps my efforts in the gym better regulated so that I do not go overboard in a single session (\u201cbecause tomorrow is a rest day\u201d) and risk injuring myself, as I\u2019ve done many times in the past when I was taking rest days.\n\n**What does my training look like?**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of my workouts are based on my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework. You can read more about programs and constructing workouts with GG on [my blog](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/). A very detailed description of GG and a progression constructed from that framework can be read in my blog \u201c[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html).\u201d Searching \u201cGeneral Gainz\u201d on reddit will provide many reviews as well as examples of programs others have created with the framework or adapted existing programs to their needs and goals.\n\nIn a nutshell, nearly all my workouts are based around using weights. When on vacation I\u2019ve had to do a few bodyweight workouts. Those would typically be done for reps against the clock, so a conditioning session. That said, I estimate that 99% of my workouts these last five years used weights of some kind (bars, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables). Most of my workouts in these five years have consisted of adding reps until I reach a determined volume threshold, then adding weight (this is called accumulation). By training in this way I have managed to set many rep max PR\u2019s. This is especially true for the squat because last year PR\u2019d rep maxes from [1RM (525LB) to 100RM (135LB)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/).\n\nNone of my workouts these last five years have consisted of only doing stretching or yoga, or going for a walk, hike, cardio only, or other such activities. I do not call shoveling snow a workout, nor chopping wood. As I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, my winters have plenty of those things which I just call \u201cliving.\u201d Some days I\u2019ll shovel snow for a few hours, then workout. That\u2019s just how it is. In general, my training resembles those common traits of strength and conditioning and/or bodybuilding training.\n\nBecause consistency is my primary goal, I am not stuck to a certain split or weekly training schedule. I have a loosely planned schedule and shift days as needed, based on how I assess my recovery. If I planned to squat but my legs are still very sore from a few days before, I will push that a day or two later, instead opting to do something like press. I have found that while I have successfully trained full body for many weeks on end, it does become tiresome, so when it does, I\u2019ll shift to a movement or body part split.\n\nThere have been several periods of time in these five years where I have trained the same lift every day for many weeks. I have done this for squat, press, and most recently, the deadlift. Such periods were great for developing those lifts. In each time I was able to reach goals, setting new personal records. Just last week I hit a 600-pound beltless conventional deadlift, a lifetime 1RM PR (the most I\u2019ve ever deadlifted without a belt). That came on the heels of training the deadlift for ten weeks, every day (at submax weights and submax volume). Before testing that 1RM I did take two days off from deadlifting (training shoulders and triceps respectively). For context, in October 2023 I barely completed a [545-pound deadlift](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzJJIFmg7eF/) while wearing a belt (and with the hype of doing that lift at my gym\u2019s deadlift party).\n\nMost of my workouts are an hour or less. If I do a conditioning workout, I try to keep those around 20 to 30 minutes. If you want to see more specific examples of workouts or lifts I\u2019ve done, you can see those on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thefeverfever/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GZCL), blog, and previous posts here on reddit.\n\n**The goals of this post are to prove that:**\n\n**1.\tRest days are just another training variable that can be manipulated to benefit training.**\n\nRest days are like the weight on the bar, the number of reps, total volume, variety of exercises, rest times, lift frequency, and so many other variables when it comes to training. There is no optimal frequency of training that applies to everyone. Likewise, there is no optimal frequency of rest days that applies to everyone. Such is the nature of individual differences. When not taking rest days, other variables need to be adjusted to account for training the next day.\n\nDoes this mean you probably cannot train every day to complete exhaustion, taking every lift to absolute failure? Yes. However, because training frequency is higher without rest days, that means skill development can be emphasized. This means greater efficiency and lower risk of injury, thereby improving work capacity and recovery potential. Over time these improve how well you can recover from heavier and/or higher volume workouts. So, as work capacity and skill increases, your ability to perform and recover from tougher workouts more frequently will likewise improve.\n\n**2.\tExcluding rest days does not necessarily inhibit progress to either size or strength.**\n\nBefore these five years I trained with rest days. I had competed in powerlifting for several years. During that period I won best lifter at a state championship as well as competing several times at the USPA American Cup and the IPL World Championships, often placing first in my weight class. I was decently strong for a lightweight powerlifter who moved up from the 148 class to the 181 class over four years.\n\nI am now bigger than I\u2019ve ever been, both in terms of overall bodyweight and the measurements across my shoulders, chest, legs, and arms. I recently achieved [18\u201d arms](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2TngiMAZ_w/?img_index=1) for the first time in my life; a goal I had set a few years ago. I also set all-time personal records in many lifts, despite not training how powerlifters usually do.\n\nNot only that, but I have trained several clients who also no longer take rest days. Each of them improving their own size and/or strength. So, not only have I grown bigger and stronger without rest days compared to those times when I was taking rest days, I have also witnessed others do the same. I credit this largely to increased training frequency and finally prioritizing more impactful recovery habits (sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing). When it comes to recovering from training, those practices matter a whole lot more than days of inactivity (AKA \u201cRest Days\u201d).\n\n**3.\tExcluding rest days is a great catalyst for improving training consistency.**\n\nWhen taking rest days it was easy for me to justify going too hard because \u201ctomorrow is a rest day.\u201d This would frequently result in going too hard, thereby necessitating unaccounted for deloads and rest days (at the time I thought rest days were a make-or-break recovery factor). Such training is akin to two steps forward one step back, and sometimes, many steps back. That kind of regression can be demotivating, which may result in a period of not training at all. While I didn\u2019t have many of those periods, and was consistent before training without rest days, now my training is far more consistent. Not only in terms of frequency, but also in terms of intensity, volume, and effort.\n\nWithout rest days I have learned how to better dial in my training, resulting in more effective workouts. Such compounding results add up! Training without rest days is now one step forward, followed by another, and countless others. Because my training is better regulated without rest days, I have not sustained a major injury that resulted in significant setbacks. Lastly, I don\u2019t have to drag myself into the gym anymore. It is now just something I do, and I am nearly every day looking forward to my workout (some workouts I know will be grueling, and I do not look forward to those as much). This is because nearly every workout produces results, albeit small; they are frequent and just as rewarding.\n\n**4.\tExcluding rest days can improve training knowledge (knowing how to train).**\n\nBecause I am not taking rest days I must account for the other variables when it comes to my training and align those in such a way that both produces results while at the same time allowing for training again tomorrow. This means that I am more aware of my effort, volume, and intensity. Without rest days, learning how to train happens faster, resulting in better progress sooner. I am now better at choosing exercises that benefit me and the way in which I execute those movements. For example, I am no longer benching as often because I feel I should, or simply that it is \u201cin my program, so I must do it.\u201d Rather, I limit that as needed while being more aggressive with other upper body pressing movements.\n\nSimilarly, I am better at constructing and executing fruitful workouts, compared to times past, when I would frequently go off plan and do more than needed, at the time believing that pushing myself to complete exhaustion and nearly always taking sets to failure was necessary to progress. That is not the case for me, or anyone. While I do believe that minimal is not optimal, the idea that more is always better is also not true. When it comes to training, as much as you can recover from is best. The only way to know that limit is to train enough to learn what that limit is and the various ways in which that limit can be reached; all while understanding that your limit will increase over time, and when it does, so too must your training.\n\n**5.\tRest days are not the make-or-break factor when it comes to recovering from workouts.**\n\nAs I\u2019ve said many times these last five years, the recovery habits that matter most are sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing. Rest days, meaning days of inactivity, are at best the worst form of recovery. Recovery depends on your work capacity. If you can only do little, you can recover from little. Gradually improving your work capacity through training increases your ability to recover. That process requires the all-important factors of sleep, nutrition, hydration, and limiting non-training related stress, not sedentary days.\n\nDays of inactivity are counterproductive most of the time. Such days would be better spent doing low-impact training like pushing a sled, or cardio, thereby improving your work capacity and therefore your ability to recover from future workouts. If rest days were necessary, then I would not have grown as big and as strong as I have in these last five years. I\u2019ve seen many people online say that not taking rest days produces negative results, guaranteed injury, burnout, and other such undesirable outcomes. The opposite is true, that is, if you learn how to train without rest days, something which necessitates prioritizing genuine recovery habits.\n\n**Common Objections**\n\nIn previous posts here on reddit, or as I\u2019ve experienced on social media, people have said a few things about my not taking rest days. Here I will address these common objections and criticisms to training daily.\n\n**1.\t\u201cBut you cannot train hard\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re not training hard enough\u201d by not taking rest days.**\n\n**Response:** In these last five years I have grown bigger and stronger than I\u2019ve ever been. My training is effective. With it I have achieved many goals. Whether you call it \u201chard\u201d means nothing in the face of my results. Hard training, while important, is not the harbinger of results. Consistency, effort, and patience are. Daily training bolsters those three all-important factors.\n\nThe definition of \u201ctraining hard\u201d is individually dependent. Some will say that all sets must be taken to failure, or very close, to train hard. Others will say that massive amounts of volume are needed to train hard. Still more will say other things about what it means to train hard; drop sets, limited rest, supersets, no machines, \u201cfunctional training\u201d only, etc. In every case the assumption is that training hard, every workout, is necessary to progress in the gym. The reality is that our definition of hard is only as hard as we\u2019ve ever pushed ourselves. Your hard may be my easy, or vice versa.\n\nThat \u201ctraining hard\u201d is necessary to progress is a false premise often made by those whose egos are built on how hard they proclaim their training to be. The fact is, my training is as hard as it needs to be, based on the session\u2019s goal and how I determine my recovery to be. I have done many of the hardest workouts of my life in these last five years. But many are not nearly so difficult. Not every session needs to be as tough as the one before it. This truth is obvious when comparing leg workouts to arm workouts. Leg days are a meme for hardship whereas arm days are often believed to be easy \u2013 because it is true! Even the hardest arms workout pales in comparison to the hardest legs workout. I will always do an arm workout when I am not feeling well because they are the easiest workouts to do with a high degree of focus, quality effort, reps, and volume.\n\nTraining consistency and recovery from that training matters far more than proximity to failure, or the volume of a single session, or other such minutia of which so many overemphasize so that they can deem their training \u201chard\u201d (and therefore, themselves). For me personally, I find lifting near max weights to be a whole lot harder than doing near max volume. It is tougher for me to recover from. Therefore, I do a lot more volume-based training. Does that mean my training is always easy because I prefer it? I guess in some way, yes. But I do not train so that I can feel hard or say that I do hard things. I train, firstly because I enjoy the process, and secondly, so that I can achieve goals.\n\nIs that process sometimes difficult? Yes. Does progress depend on training always being difficult? No. Sometimes one more rep or one more pound comes easily, and those are just two forms of many kinds of progress to be made in the gym.\n\n**2.\t\u201cTraining every day doesn\u2019t make you more hard-core\u201d and \u201cHard-core lifters cannot train daily\u201d (therefore, I am not hard-core, as such accusers themselves identify).**\n\n**Response:** I agree with this. I am not hard-core for training daily. Furthermore, manufactured hardship, as weight training necessarily is, is something I do not see has being inherently or distinctly \u201chard.\u201d There is nothing \u201chard-core\u201d about the gym. It is quite a comfortable hobby, even when it is difficult. Even when there is pain, or, paradoxically, discomfort, the act of weight training is safe, nearly always indoors in climate-controlled gyms, with purpose-built equipment, done for self-improvement via sustained incremental progress. It costs money and time. It is firstly, a selfish act. It is, therefore, not a practice through which one experiences genuine hardship and thereby becomes hard themselves. Lifting weights is a luxury, a pleasure, and therefore, not hard-core. I don\u2019t pretend it is and hope more begin to see it my way.\n\n**3.\tTraining every day is not optimal.**\n\n**Response:** This argument is often paired alongside the idea that training hard is required to progress. Thus, rationally (though incorrect), if training hard then rest days are necessary because if you are not taking rest days then you cannot be training hard. Superficially, this makes sense. However, after a moment of deeper consideration, even the meatiest head will see that it is possible to train hard one way and the next day train something else just as hard. Such is possible when employing any kind of split, whether that be by movement, or body part, or other variables such as volume, intensity, or density.\n\nAs touched on in the previous section, sometimes progress comes easily. It has been my experience that with a sensible structure and methodical progression, bolstered by keen autoregulation practices, that adding another rep or putting on five more pounds is less daunting compared to those times when I was always grinding myself into dust trying to eek out every pound, every rep, at every opportunity \u2013 at the cost of pain, which I conflated with progress; a common outlook regarding training. Such a mindset about training is based on the fear of missing out (FOMO), which from my experience, produces short lived results, injuries, and dwindling enthusiasm in the gym.\n\nThere is no standard of \u201coptimal\u201d that applies to everyone. The most recoverable work is optimal. That depends on the individual. That said, there is truth in the importance of frequency, volume, intensity (meaning load respective of 1RM), and effort. None of those things can be eschewed completely. Each is a variable that must be deliberately adjusted based on the individual\u2019s goals and abilities. The first among those variables is frequency, something which rest days inherently limits. Higher training frequency means more opportunities to reach the limit of recoverable work, which is always the most optimal way to train. Frequency is king among variables (*Mentzer cultists in shambles*).\n\n**4.\t \u201cBut you would be bigger and stronger if you were taking rest days.\u201d**\n\n**Response:** Such hackneyed remarks are made by those trying to ignite FOMO within me without considering my training history. For a decade I took rest days and \u201ctrained hard\u201d (as I understood it then). I was strong then. But now, I am both bigger and stronger \u2013 without taking rest days.\n\nThis bromide idea is held by those say, \u201cRest days produce results, not the training\u201d in one breath and in the next say, \u201cI train harder than you, so I need rest days.\u201d So, which is it? If the first, then training hard does not matter, only the rest days. If the second, then the training matters more than the rest days. The third position is that both matter equally, then necessitating equal rest days to training days, something not seen amongst the biggest and strongest lifters who often promote training up to 6x a week and sometimes multiple times per day.\n\nThis statement placates the accuser who themselves has FOMO about their training and their recovery, believing that without rest days they would be missing out on gains. I would bet the opposite because I\u2019ve experienced it myself. Rest days limited my progress because I trained less and my training was less recoverable because I over emphasized the importance of inactivity, placing it above better means of recovery.\n\nRest days improving recovery is not a guarantee for everyone, because as I said above, rest days are merely another variable. They are not a fixed need and are the lowest tier of importance when it comes to recovering from workouts. Do some people need rest days, yes. Might they see better results without them? Perhaps. That is only knowable if one attempts to train without rest days, adjusting other variables as needed, including prioritizing the more important aspects of recovery (sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing).\n\n**5.\t\u201cThe science shows that rest days are needed to progress.\u201d**\n\n**Response:** This is a false claim made by those appealing to an authority which they have no meaningful connection to or understanding of. There is not a single study that unequivocally proves that regardless of how one trains that rest days are required to get bigger and stronger. Such claims are often paired with remarks about \u201cCNS burnout\u201d or \u201csystemic fatigue\u201d which is also false. Lifting weights is remarkably easier to recover from than other activities, in particular running, which people do daily for years on end without objection. How? By adjusting the many variables we have at our disposal to increase our training frequency.\n\nThough some authorities on training may claim rest days are needed, they lack practical experience training without them while at the same time carrying a bias due to their investment in particular methods of training and the brand in which their status rests upon. Might rest days be needed because of the way they train and their recovery habits? Sure. That, however, does not prove that progress cannot be made unless rest days are taken. One such figure is Mike Israetel, PhD., who made a video on this topic, which [I responded to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAZ85sXNJKQ). Though highly credentialed and regarded in the training community, his take is remarkably bad, irrational, and contradicts his own material.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nRest days, commonly practiced as day of low activity or inactivity, encourage doing too much in the gym in a single workout than one can recover from while at the same time limiting training frequency and therefore slow the improvement of work capacity and skill development. That was the case when I was taking rest days during the first decade of my training and I am sure it is for many of you. Therefore, I argue that rest days can inhibit progress rather than help it, as they did my own. As a result of my experience, I encourage you to see if increasing your training frequency (with a likewise increase in your recovery habits; sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing) will increase your results.\n\nConsider whether rest days are something that inhibits you or benefits you. Are rest days when you backslide, eat poorly, sleep little, and stress over other parts of your life? Are they days you take because you find yourself going too hard in the gym and frequently grinding yourself into the dirt and potentially causing injury? Or might rest days be days you need because you simply do not like training? Think about your rest days and why you take them, and how you can make them better \u2013 perhaps including not taking them and training instead. Decreasing days of inactivity might not mean lifting weights more often, but perhaps doing more cardio, or some other form of physical exercise that you enjoy. Training without rest days for you does not have to look how it does for me. Find the appropriate level of activity for you, and should you find that to be lacking, strive to gradually do more.",

    "selftext": "So I am kinda new to taking lifting seriously so I chose to get most of my workout plans from google and simply alter them. In one of the articles I was reading it said that as a beginner I should increase my weight/ and or number in set each workout due to  the fast increase in muscle I will have due to being a beginner. While I already expected not to notice anything for a while the lack of change in two months is not concerning however I simply can't keep up with the adding weight aspect. I can lift the weight but I just can't keep good form and go on for that long of sets with those standards. This week I had to save myself twice while lifting (once while on bench and the other whilw squatting) nd I just don't think this is substantial. Any tips to get past this hurdle would be helpful. Also while I am here below are some more niche problems I have been having with the gym that a answer would be helpful.\n\n1. Why am I stuck at a weight? I understand that earlier I started in the post that I don't mind but thoughout 2 months I haven't gained a single pound. Since I was about 14 I have always been very lean, but I feel it has gotten to the point where my body is fighting me actively. To the point where it feels almost unhealthy and unsafe to fight it.\n\n2. How to not feel discouraged after failing a set? Due to lifting alone all I feel are infinite eyes looking at me when I fail a low bench. Due to me always being small the weight I am failing are also small. Due to this I just get up and leave after I fail to close grip bench 2 35's and have to roll the little weight of of me. When this happens I just get up and act like I just finished and leave despite just starting due to dying of embarrassment.\n\nSorry that this post is unorganized I just left the gym prematurely due to the problem explained in number two and would rather not feel terrible for doing that again. Thank you in advance and have a good day.",

    "selftext": "On the last episode of \"Goddamn Jannies, Amirite Fellas?\":\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/14ctakj/the_future_of_rfitness/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/16gu89r/the_future_of_rfitness_update/\n\nHowdy!\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out that it was resoundingly *not* just a few weeks until we could reopen with the support of new tools, as I shared back in September. The short, vague version is that bad things happened in my personal life and that takes priority over Reddit shit.\n\nThat being said, the last few weeks I've been running extensive tests on the new moderation tools, and have them up and running in a permanent fashion. Barring any unforeseen explosions, the final round of testing will be finished this week and we will be reopening r/Fitness to allow posts again **next Monday, 3/18**.\n\nBefore you get *too* excited, keep in mind that this does not mean the sub is going to become a free for all, except on our traditional yearly \"This is why you don't actually want that\" event for April Fool's Day. Posts can be made, but will still be removed if they break [The Rules\u2122](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules), are better suited for the Daily Thread (which will continue on as normal), or at our whims as unpaid jannies that do it for free who require digital oppression to become aroused.",
