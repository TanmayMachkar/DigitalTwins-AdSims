If he can\u2019t just vaporize Spectre then it\u2019s a battle without end since it\u2019s impossible to kill Dr Manhattan unless you destroy every universe simultaneously considering he exists in all realities and can recreate himself even when he has no atomic particles left. \n\nDr Manhattan is the ultimate \u201cyou can\u2019t do anything to me\u201d character because his body is essentially an avatar for his consciousness which exists beyond space time and whatever universe you are currently interacting with him in. Coupling this with the fact he can recreate his body on a whim from nothing you can\u2019t kill him.

When he does he has plot armor up to the eyeballs with some bullshit device or it\u2019s some meme team making the material that knows nothing of power scaling like when he kicked Darkseid and made him stumble in the animated series. Most of his villains he battles are more grounded street level and when it\u2019s the high end fights he functions as the JL\u2019s tactical leader and not a front line fighter like Superman and Wonder Woman. Sam getting slapped around by Red Hulk would be like Batman taking a punch from Solomon Grundy in his stronger revivals or Doomsday before his scaling went wild and then Batman survives which is just not happening. If Sam had taken the super solider enhancement that\u2019s a different story but they chose not to do that. My biggest issue is that bro\u2019s head is completely exposed so that is getting splattered or his brain is turning to mush since vibranium isn\u2019t taking that impact damage. Even if he just hits the ground or a wall he is at best brain damaged from the force even if his head doesn\u2019t make impact since, as stated, vibranium is not taking the shock from impact. GIVE THE MAN A HELMET and then we can have a rational discussion on how he tanks Red Hulk punches. If a car crash can potentially cause brain bleeding or brain damage to the unprotected skull of a regular person then flying into a wall or street from the impact speed of a Red Hulk punch sending you flying is doing that and more.\n\nI despise the \u201cvibranium armor for everyone\u201d crap because it\u2019s a total cop out in the MCU now when it was unique to Cap\u2019s shield and Black Panther\u2019s armor before. Instead of having to actually show how to use tactics and skill in a fight why bother when \u201coh it\u2019s fine I have vibranium armor and can\u2019t lose\u201d. It\u2019s gotten to be ridiculous because we have regular dudes taking hits from characters that have been some of the heaviest hitters. Even Black Panther used stealth for takedowns and his armor was way more advanced with its kinetic absorption.\n\nBatman uses hit and run, smoke bombs, and long range gadgets along with traps to gain his victories. During Batman vs Superman in the fight Superman blatantly holds back to extreme degrees both in the comics and on screen because he knows if he punched Batman for real then even with Batman\u2019s strongest plot armor that boy is gonna be a blood stain. They could have easily shown Sam using all his skills and combat knowledge to avoid Red Hulk and use his guns, flight, taunts, and gear to avoid a single hit but nope, gotta show how the regular human without any enhancements other than gear tanks hits from Red Hulk who has laid the beat down on the Silver Surfer and other Marvel powerhouses. Even if this Red Hulk is nerfed he is still a Hulk.",

So of course they are going to reject whatever told them that and want to burn it down. \n\nThey have a view that is totally different to the rest of us. You gave examples of protesting they'd throw it back at you and say \"what did it accomplish? Nothing. If protesting worked we wouldn't be allowed to do it\".\n\nIt is honestly a miracle that the majority of these types numb themselves daily with Porn/Drugs/Alcohol or slip into virtual worlds with gaming. They are angry desperate. \n\nIf something doesn't change the numbers of people who feel this way and similar will continue to grow. It really worries me.",

Many don't bring it up at all but there has been maybe 30-40 (out of the hundreds if not closer to 1000-2000 young people we've helped) over the few years that have discussed it. To many the last general election was their first or second time voting. From what I've managed to work out it splits into a few different camps. \n\n1. Middle finger vote. This is the most common I've heard. \n\nThey just don't care and think it will be funny to piss everyone off.\n\n2. Anti Immigration vote. This is obvious. \n\nYou'll hear ranging views from \"just deporting all the boat people\" to \"everyone after the boris wave\" which I had no clue and had to ask and it seems to mean everyone (Legal and illegal) who has arrive since Boris took charge. To the most extreme I've heard where everyone again legal and illegal who has arrived since Tony Blair took charge.\n\n3. Don't trust the Tory/Labour/Lib Dems to be able to provide a future they are willing to join society for. (This is the smallest group yet one I worry about the most)\n\nThey won't bother joining the workforce and society as a whole unless we return to the past. By this they usually mean to be able to have a home and able to raise a family on one person's wage like how either their dad or grandad's generation did. Not a life of luxury but to be able to keep their head above water. Their partner/girlfriend/wife can be as one said a \"trad wife\". Which I took to mean a 1950's housewife and not need to work and just focused on chores/errands/child raising. \n\nThese young lads/men openly talk about waiting for it all to burn down and how they numb themselves with porn or alcohol or drugs or gaming. They joke about wanting a 21st century Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar to come along and just get rid of bureaucracy and get stuff done. As show by the independent article linked below. \n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/genz-dictatorship-survey-jordan-peterson-b2686927.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/genz-dictatorship-survey-jordan-peterson-b2686927.html)\n\nMore than half (52 per cent) of Gen Z\u00a0think the UK would be a better place if a strong leader \u201cwho does not have to bother with parliament and elections\u201d was in charge.\n\nAt the moment as a society we just ignore these people or call them stupid or racist. It is probably viewed as a good thing by those in power that these young men do numb themselves with their vices because the other options are too scary to think about.",

Other items that give nonhealing classes healing are almost always overpowered, like the half-zatoichi or conch which when used as intended don't really have any major downside and outweigh losing a shotgun at worse to being a direct upgrade at best. Shotgun heavy gives you much faster access to dps even if only at short ranges. I would even argue at close distance the shotgun is always better than the minigun if unreved. The major downside to the shotgun is its range, where the minigun becomes much better. The only downside to the sandwiches is the eating animation, which isn't an issue when you have a medic, and it becomes an instant mid health pack and where the second ot takes to rev isn't as dire because you have an extra 150 hp alread and if you need the expediety of the shotgun to save your med from a bombing enemy you should have chosen the shotgun or have had better positioning and or awareness. Not to mention the second bannana being op for medicines team comps.\nAnyways, Thanks for listening to my Tedtalk \n\nTL;DR the sandwich is already overpowered enough.",

Hope that helps!",

      "body": "Honestly, I kind of have to respectfully disagree. Aside from the leveling aspect, which I do agree with, leveling is basically non-existent and does a horrible job world building/teaching you how to play your class. Aside from that though, I think trying to say that today\u2019s wow is dumbed down compared to vanilla/TBC/Wrath feels a little off. Aside from talent trees (which, I\u2019d say in retail now is closer to the complexity of vanilla etc), the classes are, imo, quite a bit harder to play than early wow. Raid mechanics are SIGNIFICANTLY harder than anything, really pre wrath. Dungeons are more than just \u201cthis guy hits really hard\u201d. I would say that wow is definitely more casual friendly, but its top end content far exceeds anything that vanilla-cata had in terms of complexity and challenge. I\u2019m not sure how you could hop on to, say, a fire mage in retail and say that it is dumbed down compared to old mages where you almost exclusively spam frostbolt. \n\nIf anything, I\u2019d say wow has done a much better job at broadening its ability to cater to almost all demographics. You have very casual content with transmog, mount collection, achievement hunting, to casual solo content with world quests and delves to challenging solo content with high end delves that you definitely need to know your class to complete. You have casual small group content with mythic 0\u2019s and low keys, to incredibly challenging small group content with high m+ keys. There\u2019s large group scaling difficulty challenges with normal/heroic raid, and very difficult large group content in mythic raiding. I think that wow has really done a decent job at actually broadening its approach to all levels of gameplay. \n\nThere was absolutely a window in wow with, I\u2019d argue, cata-shadowlands where they were absolutely dumbing it down pretty hard, but since the start of dragonflight, I personally feel that they\u2019ve done a good job and bringing back some of the complexity to the game and classes.

The first, and easiest method is, when they enter your line of site, you\u2019ll usually see the chest open slightly and you\u2019ll see the teeth and mouth of the mimic. I haven\u2019t been able to validate whether leaving the room and coming back forces them to do it again, if it\u2019s a timed thing, or if they only do it once. \n\nThe second and most consistent method is based on the key latch. As you can tell from the bottom chest and the normal chest, their key latch is higher than the other two. That is a telltale sign that they\u2019re mimics! \n\nAgain, this specifically works as long as you don\u2019t have the mimic\u2019s tooth relic. If you have that, that makes it harder to detect them. I hope this helps!",

The worst part though, the first time I saw her get an allergic reaction, she was eating a turkey jerky stick. Turns out, a lot of turkey jerky uses beef casin (spelling?), we learned to read more closely after that. We still ate and drank dairy, she would generally just get some hives if she ate a lot of that. Crazy thing, when she was pregnant with our daughter, a little over a year ago, she was really craving a hamburger, and she wanted to risk it while we were on vacation because it can go away on its own sometimes. The allergy just went away, we aren\u2019t sure if it was the pregnancy, or if it had just ran its course, but now she is alpha gal free.",

So for this question specifically, the only answer is Tauren. \n\nHonestly, nowadays, the race doesn\u2019t truly matter. They will both function perfectly fine, unless you intend to start working on the .1% of content. So at the end of the day, pick whichever race you find more aesthetically pleasing. \n\nAs far as racials go, Tauren receive a 1% (I\u2019m not actually sure about the number, so please don\u2019t quote me on that) stamina buff, so higher health pool. They also have an AoE stun with a very fast cast time, but a short range. So that can definitely be useful. \n\nHighmountain, if I\u2019m not mistaken, receive a 1% versatility buff, which is again, nice, but verse as far as I\u2019m aware, isn\u2019t the #1 stat for any of the specs. Even if it is, 1% is negligible to 99.9% of the community. They also have a stun, but it\u2019s in the form of a charge forward, stunning everything in their path. So again, useful, but by no means any sort of class defining feature. \n\nI, personally, prefer Tauren because I choose my races based more on transmog ability than racials and though the highmountain Tauren can have somewhat cool horns, they don\u2019t fit the aesthetic that I am going for in a paladin. Additionally, I prefer the stationary stun, over the directional stun, but that\u2019s a pure preference. \n\nTL;DR the class doesn\u2019t matter from a play style perspective, and you should choose your class based on what you think looks best/resonate with from a lore perspective/randomly, unless you intended to do the absolute top in, hard content.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I are getting married in 2 months, and I entered the relationship without children, and she has a 6 year old daughter (I entered when she was 4). I have always said that my fianc\u00e9 takes priority, but I say that for a couple of reasons. \n\n1) Her happiness is my priority, and our relationship is my priority. I know that one of her biggest impacts on her happiness is the wellbeing of her daughter and having a quality, loving, father since the blood father is very inconsistent and one foot in one foot out type of guy. So I am trying to be that father figure she wants for her daughter. \n\n2) I feel, as a father, it is my job to show our children what a loving, healthy relationship is. I need to teach her daughter how a person should treat their SO. Her biggest impression of how a relationship should be is the relationship of her parents. I can\u2019t control how her father\u2019s relationships go, but I can control how her mom\u2019s relationship is. I\u2019m not saying she has to do what we do, just that I want to show her that she shouldn\u2019t be with someone that mistreats her, or can\u2019t communicate with her, or doesn\u2019t foster their relationship.\n\nI have always wanted to be a father, and I love her daughter as if she were my own, and I won\u2019t ever make her feel like I don\u2019t, so I am not doing all of this to appease my fianc\u00e9 or because I feel obligated to. I have always had this thought regardless of if I was a step parent or not. I believe that if our relationship is as good as it can be, then it will make all of the other pieces fall together. It will allow us to handle the trials of parenting effectively because our relationship is healthy, and there won\u2019t be some unsaid resentment that adds on to the difficulties of parenting. \n\nAt the end of the day, you do you, but like many people have said on this post, an unhealthy relationship leads to divorce, which leads to limited time with the child you are prioritizing.",

      "body": "I just got a Great Dane puppy about 7 weeks ago now. I brought him in with my rescue that I got about 3 years ago when she was 1.5 years old, she is a mix of a bunch of dogs, but mostly German Shepard, husky, boxer, and Australian cattle dog. I was a little worried when I\u2019d introduce them because she is very docile, pretty protective of my fianc\u00e9 and and my soon to be 6 year old step child (I only specify that to convey that my rescue hadn\u2019t been with the child since I brought her home). She is touchy with her hips, has evidence of abuse, overall, I was just a little worried how she would adjust to a rambunctious puppy, that would rapidly out size her. \n\nLong story short, they play and get along wonderfully, he is now her size, if not a little bigger than she is, but when they played, I let the older dog (her name is kora) teach Finley (the Dane) her boundaries, supervised of course. If I felt their play was getting a little energetic, and one of them was getting overwhelmed, I would usually separate Finley from her with a toy, and let her catch her breath a little bit. \n\nI think the best way to teach a dog how to interact with a dog, and learn their boundaries, is to let them interact and teach each other. Pay attention to their body language, if it looks like the smaller dog is getting defensive and overwhelmed, separate them. And obviously, obedience train them. Need to be able to control both dogs when tempers start getting flared or adrenaline and instinct start to kind of take over.",

The rest of the cast doesn't exist just to marvel at how great Hiral is, or just exist to be added to a harem. They actually serve a purpose in battle and are their own people. The world building is solid and the nebulous \"enemy\" is a potent and persistent threat with ways all it's own to raise the stakes.\nUnfortunately where it fell apart for me is the story's inability to stop and breath. The first book is a solid start, but book 2 just doesn't stop. Too much action means less time engaging the characters and expanding on who they are, and book 2 felt like a nonstop action sequence. Fight some battles, race to the next dungeon while fighting monsters, rinse and repeat until boss fight occurs. The near nonstop fighting became more of a tedious chore than exciting or engaging and by the time I got to the end, I just didn't care about them fighting the big boss.\nI feel too much action can detrimental as too little in these stories and Rune Seeker just had way too much. I finished Book 2 but I find that I'm burned out on the series. I can't bring myself to pick up book 3, even though I would like to see more of characters power sets and learn more about the world and characters.",

She and JNR get attacked by Tyrian who they are completely helpless against. The man takes them apart while toying with them and even supercharging Nora does jack shit to improve the odds as he effortlessly blocks her attack. Has to be saved by Qrow, only to incessantly interfere in the fight and make things worse, resulting in Qrow getting poisoned. Then, when Ozpin suggests that they need more training she stupidly states \"we already know how to fight\" completely ignoring all the times she got her ass beat. Never mind Roman and  Neo, the four of them couldn't handle just one member of Salem's inner circle when he was just playing with them. It's just a long, long list of fuck ups and she never learns from any of them. She is willfully ignorant of her own shortcomings to the point that it borders on being arrogance.

What's more, Neo is the polar opposite of Yang. Yang is loud and goofy, Neo is quiet and dignified. Yang's semblance enhances her strength, Neo's creates illusions and misdirection. Yang is (at this point) a good person that tries to help people, Neo is a sadist that delights in killing people. Neo is the worst kind of opponent for Yang because she can beat her in a straight fight with little effort, and if she chooses to use her semblance, it only makes things harder for Yang. Unfortunately, nothing ever comes of this. Yang barely even acknowledges Neo despite being completely humiliated by her. Neo's desire to kill Ruby over Torchwick should give them a reason to clash, but instead Neo has carry Cinder's useless ass everywhere and Yang's only concern by the time they meet again is Blake. Blake is literally the only thing Yang gives a damn about, so any apparent rivalry is always going to fall by the wayside. Like much of a RWBY, it's a good idea with botched execution.",

Or else the power system of which ever world the fight is taking place in, will always win.  Bleach loses to Black Clover because the power system of Bleach doesn\u2019t exist in that media.  Thus soul reapers instantly die once they leave their world.  Quid pro quo Asta is stronger than Ichigo.   Fuck it, the power system doesn\u2019t exist in Baki either.  So the character with no super powers is stronger than the character with super powers (who is show to be able to cut mountains in half).\n\nThat\u2019s not the issue I\u2019m addressing though.  I\u2019m addressing the shit tier explaining authors do about how their power systems work and what the limits are.  Again, because they are almost always based off \u201cthe rule of cool\u201d instead of a definitive rule set.\n\nThat is why power scaling verse to verse is fucking stupid and pointless.

You go there in each session, tell how's it has been, what's more in situation and they will basically assist you and describe you meds if it is required each time. So, over time it becomes same.  So, I would advise that you really listen to them and get out the struggle you are facing. The sooner the better. I I have been going there for almost two years now. I have improved, but root cause is still there. \nAlso, I feel that chatgpt can better assist sometimes if you describe your situation accurately. (Just saying this as a alternative.)",

As per UGC, you need at least thirteen years as a Deputy Librarian in a university library or eighteen years\u2019 experience as a College Librarian. Of course, you have to done ph.d., NET/SLET. Some extra work like: published articles in various journals, publish a book, etc. It depends on the university you are applying to. For some reputed university it will be tough and for local universities, it's all about connection and location. In some states they don't give vacancy for government job for librarian and because of that in many universities seats of BLIS students remains empty.\n\n2. Yes, tech-savy librarian's get more preference. But it's all about how you show your self in the interview. Library is service oriented job. It's all about how you cater yourself and communicate, because in India in the name of digitization they thought is about soul/koha and some consortium. It's just a skill which anyone can acquire. But yeah you sure get preferences(Because, you can do all the work of a clerk when needed) I have done CSE, getting job at any local college or school is easy.\n\n3. All libraries need someone who can digitalise their library. So, yeah I think you can dug deeper in that. I have seen some people on linkdln who assist librarian regarding koha related stuff. For research assistant I don't think you can get any gig, because everyone have their mentors. Still, you can give it a try. \n\n4. For skill development I would advise you to take online courses on : Google, Swayam, Edx etc. \n\nI personally feel getting job somewhere good is easy, if you have strong and unique portfolio. Publish articles, present them in seminars, clear NET/SLET. Make connections on LinkedIn and be in touch with all your Teachers. \n\n(I am still a newbie in this field, so if I said something wrong then sorry. All the best)",

In some ICSE school you are only allowed to speak in English or you will have to pay the fine. I have worked in CBSE school, where we can speak Hindi too but not a word in Gujrati. And of course no parents have any issues with that. They all want IITs, AIIMS, IIMs. Yeah, Gujrati is passing on by generation vocationally.

If you look at the number of those getting FCH in many courses, yes there are always scholars and females who did not need to go NS. At the same time, there are many males who went through NS. If they can do it, so can you. It's difficult to pick back up and go at your top mental speed from Day 1. But don't worry, you will be able to rebuild and regain your intensity with discipline. \n\n  \nSecond, there is now a mental difference between you and someone who did not do NS. Those who don't do NS are always in the educational system. Maybe their mind works faster now, and they are more used to academic concepts and studying. But apart from studies, NS does add a whole other dimension to your life. Even if you hated NS and NS sucked, you can now treasure your time in uni more. Maybe NS also thought you other things which may be useful in your studies. It's not a wasted experience. \n\n  \nStay positive and determined. Many have done it. You will be able to get back stronger.",

Following the logic of TOTW players prices (you used Antonio Valencia as an example of how prices are inflated, fall, then rise), if potm cards aren\u2019t packed, supply will be low and the price will rise over the year.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure if demand would fall? Players will want higher rated wingers as the game progresses, and release of more high rated gold card wingers (say willian or salah) may bring the demand for Lucas potm down.\n\nDo you know whether the prices of potm from past years rose or fell?

For example we might not see say Usopp and Chopper fighting over whether they should head in a particular direction because Jinbei has knowledge of sea currents and would point the ship in the right direction. My point is that he is rather sensible compared to the rest of the crew. It would be interesting if Oda decides to add some quirks to Jinbei.",

He did do it faster than Naruto though, much faster.\n\nBoruto also recreated the Flying Raijin. It\u2019s different to Minato\u2019s and weaker I believe but he did re create it.\n\nEdit: I did forget about Rasengan Uzuhiko which is a very cool variation of the Rasengan.\n\nBut most of Boruto\u2019s power comes from his Karma Seal.\n\nNaruto\u2019s comes from Kurama and his massive chakra reserves.\n\nMinato is just a badass.

You could make clones but they were truly perfect copies that follow your orders. So they take a lot of damage before they pop an disappear. Even more than the likes of wood clones.\n\nEdit 2: so just thought of something else for the clone ability. You could have it be a single clone but one that\u2019s a truly perfect copy. You\u2019re completely indistinguishable except for the fact that the clone has a time limit of about 30 mins.\n\nSo it has blood and can die like a normal human, except it\u2019s completely subservient. \n\nIf you want to nerf it a bit.

It\u2019s unfortunate that we don\u2019t really now the full extent of Fugaku, Shisui and Sakumo\u2019s power so I can\u2019t give an accurate answer.\n\nAll of them were said at some point to be strong ninja. Asuma is irrelevant in this fight, he does nothing unfortunately since I like Asuma.\n\nWe saw in the war arc an Eight Gate Guy can almost beat Juubidara so Eight Gate Guy beats Prime Madara on his own in my opinion.\n\nSo that basically just leaves the rest versus Hashirama. Unfortunately we also don\u2019t know much about prime Hashirama except that he can beat Prime Madara and The Kyuubi together.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if Hashirama would lose or win. Let\u2019s assume that guy dies just after he kills Madara so he can\u2019t use the eight gates gassing Hashirama.\n\nHashirama has a massive advantage in this fight. Just looking at what he was capable of in his fight with Madara. The Kanon is just sick.\n\nI believe most of the Jonin would survive that attack simply because Kakashi can send them to the Kamui dimension or Minato can teleport them away.\n\nIn the end I believe it comes down to longevity. I believe with Minato teleporting around and potentially saving people from death or Obito pulling the focus on him and using Kamui to dodge attacks, they could last a good amount of time.\n\nUnfortunately I do think they\u2019d lose. I don\u2019t believe they have the attack power to put Hashirama down for good.\n\nSummary: With Koto and Tsukiyomi, the Jonin\u2019s win. Without those two technique, Hashirama and Madara win.",

It should\u2019ve been obvious.\n\nNow as to why the people who knew didn\u2019t tell him. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because Minato has a shit load of enemies, the Hidden Stone for example that would want to kill Naruto as revenge.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t that good of a reason considering he has the name Uzumaki and is also a Jinchuriki so the target on his back can\u2019t really get any bigger.",

In my opinion from the characters I know Team Japan or Korea are taking this.\n\nI\u2019m going off the pictures so this is original series Ben 10. This is that version of a hulk which I believe is 616. So not like Worldbreker Hulk.\n\nTeam Japan first. Goku is of course strong but I\u2019m fairly sure Madoka and Rimuru end up or se stronger than this version of Goku which I believe is battle of gods. One punch Man is also quite powerful. I don\u2019t know much about Sonic, I know when he gets the chaos Gem, or whatever it\u2019s called, sonic turns into the white version and gains fucking reality warping to an extent but I\u2019m going off the image so I think they all just die.\n\n\nTeam America next. Obviously Ben 10 gets destroyed. This is original series who only has 10 aliens and none of them are as strong as the likes of feedback, alien x or atomix. \n\nBatman with one year of prep I don\u2019t matters at all. I think he gets destroyed by most of the opponents. Superman and Hulk are int he same boat cause I don\u2019t think the main timeline versions are that strong compared to some of there stronger versions like world break a hulk or prime one million superman.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Spawn except his name and I think SpongeBob\u2019s cartoon fuckery gets beat by some of the hax in this image.\n\nTeam Korea next. The obvious ones are Sung Jin Woo, Jin Mori or Sun Wukong. Now I haven\u2019t finished God Of Higschool so I can\u2019t say much about Jin Mori and I haven\u2019t finished solo levelling in awhile so I can\u2019t really comment on him but I do know both get pretty strong. I think around planetary.\n\nThe top right is the dude from Greatest Estate Developer, great read, go check it out. He isn\u2019t that strong at all, maybe building level or something like that.\n\nThe other two I have no idea who they are.\n\nFinally Team China. The leader is of course Game Sun Wukong as the OP said in another comment. So he doesn\u2019t just immediately murder everyone and become immortal another 3 times. The guy ends up becoming the fighting Buddha. He strains nirvana like Buddha which is just insane so thank god this isn\u2019t that Wukong.\n\nThe one on the bottom right is know but can\u2019t remember the name of the anime and also haven\u2019t watched much of it awnaywy so I can\u2019t comment.\n\nThe one on the middle right is Hajun who I think is supposed to be really strong but again I don\u2019t much about him so I can\u2019t comment.\n \nThe rest of them I have zero clue about.\n\n\n\nSo based on all of this, I think Team Japan wins.",

I dont know why watching a hero performing a skill is much more easier to learn than reading it for me. I watched every single hero and i started learning the mechanics. I wouldnt recomend watching it in 2024 because there are major changes to some heroes. But yeah i have around 1000 hours in and i am still learning to this day.\n\nGrasp the basics and literally just have fun. I would recommend playing turbo if you are a casual gamer. Gold and XP gains are 2X faster and also games end much faster. Playing a normal match after playing turbo is really draggy. Play with bots first and test different heroes to start out.",

There are countless ways an average Malaysian can get money, you have online marketing (Instagram, Tiktok), globalization literally makes it super easy for anyone to get products from China, you can source items by a few clicks on your phone.  I am not saying that being the ultra wealthy is easy , it does take luck as well but being living comfortably is achievable. \n\nAnother fact is that Malaysia has one of the kindest people in the world. You can actually walk up to a Mak Cik by the roadside stall, and they would talk to you like you are their own son, talking about their day. Not only that people are actually willing to share knowledge if you ask the right questions and being socially inept knowing how to approach people. I have sat down with people from all economic backgrounds and chat with them and how they made their wealth. Its surprising how some make money, i know one who makes millions producing fishnet, yes fishnets. Do not let a few bad apples ruin the whole basket. You cannot find people like Malaysians anywhere else.\n\nComplaining does not do anyone good. Wealth inheritance is something no one can take control off. Comments here are saying everyone with a wealth inheritance also has a bad attitude, showing off their lifestyle. Heck, if anyone here had that they would too, could you blame them? But i also have friends who flaunt their wealth online but are the kindest and generous people ever.

So you want those at 16 in character creation and get WIS to 20 as you progress through the game. \n\nINT is your dump stat so 8 is fine. If she is not your avatar/party face CHA 8 is also fine. \n\nTrickery Domain is one of the weaker cleric subclasses so if you decide to change her subclass to one that gives her heavy armor proficiency you can drop DEX to 10 and take the Alert feat.\nDEX however also affects initiative so 14 DEX is always good even with heavy armor.\n\nA lot about how to play clerics comes down to spell usage. Although they can excel at any role if built correctly, they are often intended to be support. Great Spells to use early game are sanctuary, create water and bless to name a few.\n\nNote that cantrips gained from race use INT as their casting stat.\n\nEarly on your spell save DC is also fairly low. So it\u2019s better to avoid save\u2013or\u2013suck spells that require enemies to fail a saving throw until you can increase your spell save DC.",

If what you saying is true there would be no reason for him to do this:\nhttps://youtu.be/pxWBIQUdPgw?si=LN7eiror8xAEOz-5\nHe would have just grabbed water form the atmosphere and shot it instead getting a different source of water, all of jimbei water attacks especially  the larger ones only happens when he\u2019s under water \nOr has a supply of water, he\u2019s not like a water bender form avatar that can move water at will and make it do what ever he wants it to do, he has to be in contact with his water supply.

Your logic is basically \u201cif I never saw it happen, then it can\u2019t happen\u201d, which is flawed, by your logic goku, gohan, piccolo or cell can\u2019t destroy a planet either because they\u2019ve never been seen doing so and beerus must not be planetary either because we\u2019ve only seen him destroy half a planet with one attack.

There are looser, casual versions of the kebaya that people do wear in everyday lives. some malay muslim people when they go to the mosque will wear batik prints (which is the print that kinda looks like the prints on kebayas). \n\ndont get me wrong, the absolute average singaporean would just wear something from uniqlo, shorts and slippers, but you do have the occasional fashionista wearing more traditional clothing. (kebaya/batik and sarong and sari are more common to see casually than cheong sam but yeah)\n\ndisclaimer: im not a fashion historian or what, i just am an average sgean speaking from personal experience.\n\n\nedit: if you are visiting singapore and want to get your mum something like that, visit arab street, they have lots of shops doing kebaya/nonya kebaya. i mean you could also probably go to malaysia or indonesia, which is probably cheaper",

If I had to do anything I must score well in exams, if I did anything else other than studies, it would become \"padhai chod ke sab kuch karva lo inse\". It made me develop a mentality that if I want to cut my birthday cake, I must study and get good grades (I am 19 and is in IIIT). This is not the case with tier 1 city kids (majority) and on reddit people who post are from tier 1 cities. And they don't have this restriction of getting good grades to do anything. So they date and post it",

SL is more realistic which means it has way more deaths which put the characters at a much larger risk. I also think it's due to how the hunters are made which doesn't allow them to get stronger that really makes sjw put himself out there. He NEEDS to get stronger, he NEEDS to stay consistent, he NEEDS to keep putting himself in these situations because he is the only person that can make humans life's better.

We don't know how strong he is but due to the amount of damage that he has done PLUS the damage he will do in the future is way more then Luffy. In comparison luffy defeated some warlords, Broke into Government facilities, a few territories, and he has vegapunk and Robin. On his run he has shown to not really do much. He doesn't randomly attack islands, and realistically he has harmed pirates more than he has the WG so I dont think they would find him much of a threat to them compared to Dragon that has been messing with them for years and on a MUCH larger scale than luffy.",

Not my favorite, but it\u2019s different from anything we\u2019ve seen before, and I love that about BFDIA: nothing stays the same.

      "body": "Length: Obviously, that's how long the rod is. Here's why it matters. For certain techniques you want a shorter rod and for some you want a longer rod. The longer the rod, the longer the cast. Of course you don't always need to make super long cast. For bass fishing all my cast are usually less than 20 yards. Shorter rods excel for techniques where you have to put a lot of action into the rod ie; a jerkbait. If you use a long rod for a jerk bait you will be hitting the side of the boat, ect. Longer rods excel for techniques like the a rig and big swimbaits since it allows more casting distance. \n\n\n\nPower: med-light, medium, med-heavy, heavy. It's how much pressure it takes to bend the rod. Why it matters is if you are throwing a light lure you want to use a lower power so you can cast further and more accurate. Power also helps with hook setting Power. You don't always want the most hook setting Power possible. Treble hook lures you don't need to set the hook hard since it's usually a lighter wire hook and it's exposed so it's possible that if you set the hook too hard then you will either rip the hook out of its mouth or you will make a hole so big the fish can easily throw the hook. For something with a thick hook like a frog you want more hook setting power\n\n\nAction: moderate, moderate-fast, fast, extra fast. This is how far the rod will bend. Fast is the top 20% and moderate is more like the top 50%. This matters because for some lures you want a more moderate, or parabolic bend. The more moderate the rod, the more the rod will absorb the shock of the fish. This allows you to keep fish on the hook when they jump and it allows you to play with them a bit more. The faster the action also usually means you feel the bite faster, not necessarily better, but faster. But of course, you don't always want to feel the bite faster. Something like a jig you want to give the fish a second before setting the hook. \n\n\nImportant to understand that these are not completely universal and it varies from brand to brand. Some brand's fast will be another brand's extra fast ect.\n\n\nAnd the lure is just a guideline and is usually pretty helpful and accurate, but it is not the end all be all. I personally would not use a rod that short for frogs. The shortest I would go is 7 ft heavy-fast for open water frigging and 7'3 heavy-fast for frigging on top of mats. Everyone has their preferences and you will find your own through time.",

      "body": "Cats, scientifically known as Felis catus, are small, carnivorous mammals that have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years. They are known for their agility, sharp claws, and keen senses, particularly their excellent night vision and acute sense of smell. Cats belong to the Felidae family, which also includes larger feline species like lions, tigers, and leopards. There are many different breeds of domestic cats, each with its own unique appearance, behavior, and personality traits.\n\nThe history of the domesticated cat is fascinating. It is believed that cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 9,000 years ago. The relationship between cats and humans began when agricultural societies emerged, and humans needed to protect their grain stores from rodents. Cats were attracted to the abundance of food and began to live in close proximity to human settlements. Over time, a mutually beneficial relationship developed, with humans providing food and shelter and cats helping to control the rodent population.\n\nCats are known for their independence and self-sufficiency, traits that have endeared them to many pet owners. Unlike dogs, which have been bred to perform specific tasks for humans, cats have largely retained their natural hunting instincts and behaviors. This independence, however, does not mean that cats do not form strong bonds with their human companions. Many cat owners report that their pets are affectionate, playful, and loyal.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of cats is their physical agility. They have flexible bodies and quick reflexes, which allow them to move gracefully and catch prey with precision. Their retractable claws are another remarkable adaptation, enabling them to climb, hunt, and defend themselves. Cats also have powerful hind legs that allow them to leap great distances and heights.\n\nCats communicate with a variety of vocalizations, body language, and behaviors. The most familiar vocalization is the meow, which cats use to communicate with humans. Cats also purr, a sound often associated with contentment but which can also indicate pain or distress. Other vocalizations include hissing, growling, and chirping. Body language, such as the position of their ears, tail, and whiskers, also plays a significant role in feline communication.\n\nThe diet of domestic cats is primarily carnivorous. In the wild, they hunt small animals such as rodents, birds, and insects. Pet cats often retain this hunting instinct, even if they are fed regular meals by their owners. It's not uncommon for cats to bring \"gifts\" of caught prey to their human companions. Commercial cat food is designed to meet the nutritional needs of cats, but some owners also choose to feed their pets raw or homemade diets.\n\nCats have a natural grooming behavior that keeps their coats clean and healthy. They use their rough tongues to remove loose fur and dirt. Grooming also serves a social function among cats, helping to strengthen bonds between individuals. Despite their grooming habits, cats can sometimes suffer from hairballs, which form when they ingest too much fur. Regular brushing by their owners can help reduce the occurrence of hairballs.\n\nThe reproductive habits of cats are also interesting. Female cats, or queens, can become sexually mature as early as six months of age. They have multiple estrous cycles throughout the year, and their litters can range from one to eight kittens. Kittens are born blind and helpless, relying entirely on their mother for nourishment and protection. They develop rapidly, beginning to explore their environment and eat solid food at around four weeks of age.\n\nCats have been featured prominently in various cultures and mythologies throughout history. In ancient Egypt, cats were revered and often depicted in art and sculpture. They were associated with the goddess Bastet, who represented home, fertility, and protection. Killing a cat, even accidentally, was considered a grave offense in ancient Egyptian society. In other cultures, cats have been both venerated and vilified. During the Middle Ages in Europe, cats were often associated with witchcraft and superstition, leading to widespread persecution.\n\nIn modern times, cats have become one of the most popular pets in the world. Their presence in popular culture is pervasive, with numerous books, movies, and internet phenomena centered around them. Cats like Grumpy Cat, Maru, and Lil Bub have achieved celebrity status online, capturing the hearts of millions with their unique appearances and charming behaviors.\n\nThe health and welfare of domestic cats are important considerations for pet owners. Regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, and parasite control are essential for maintaining a cat's health. Spaying or neutering cats is also recommended to prevent overpopulation and reduce the risk of certain health problems. Providing a stimulating environment with plenty of opportunities for play and exercise is crucial for a cat's mental and physical well-being.\n\nCats are remarkable creatures that have adapted well to living alongside humans while retaining much of their wild nature. Their unique combination of independence, agility, and affection has made them beloved companions to people around the world. Whether they are lounging in a sunbeam, chasing a toy, or curling up in their owner's lap, cats continue to captivate and charm us with their mysterious and endearing ways.",

I found them to be helpful to keep \u00e0 sense of direction without \u00e0 minimap, but others could complain about this and nobody could say it's wrong.\n\n 3) Lack of minimap. Again depends on who you are as a gamer. For me it was a 100% pro since it favorised immersion and wonder, but it's something not for everyone.\n\n4) fights might become a bit repetitive if you feel the need to grind. However, the variety of enemies is still large and boring fights can be beaten in seconds with proper builds (instadeath cannon being one of the most amazingly fun thing you find towards the later part of the game xD it's not named that, but you will understand)\n\n5) while the music is god tier, it's sometimes looping on repetitively. This annoyed me exactly twice in 64 hours.\n\n6) some people have complained about the UI for pictos and lumen. I'd say this is the game weakest aspect indeed.

Sure, he was scared. But also, one thing I noticed with the other members who died is that they essentially, gave up. What I mean is how when  Jeon-young (I think, the glasses guy) died, he gave up. So did On-jo's father in his last moments, despite their last response not quite being fear entirely. Cheong-san in the last scene we see of him was more concerned with taking down Gwi-nam and getting to safety.",

The entire virus exists because there's a will to survive that's so strong that they'll keep rising up no matter how many times you stab and injure them. Gwi-Nam in his last moments, all he wished for was to get revenge. Namra, idrk tbf, maybe her only goal was to save Su-Hyeok but you're right, it's similar to On-jo's father who was also concerned about the survival of his daughter but he still turned. Maybe it's all about vengeance. A purpose to survive. Their willpower so strong they keep fighting and keep getting up. Idk about Nam-ra but this would make sense for Gwi-Nam, Eun-ji and Cheong-san. They all must've had some or the other reason to survive. If Cheong-san didn't want to survive, he wouldn't have ducked from the nuke. But yeah, it's tough. It's definitely got some holes.",

That is such a strong episode and episode 2 is the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Naruto (the character) completely won me over in the first episode.

It was great. \ud83d\ude01 It\u2019s been one of my absolute favorite fandoms ever since. I love how it\u2019s so deep and yet so funny. So relatable.

That\u2019s my opinion more than a fact since I hate jazz but it is my criticism. I don\u2019t like one single song. Not even remotely. \n\n3. The color palette is drab. \n\n4. The swamp is not a fun setting.\n\n5. They waste the perfectly good setting of New Orleans to replace it with the time in the swamp which feels extremely dragged out. \n\n6. None of the side characters, minus Tiana\u2019s parents and Lottie are funny or interesting. Ray Louis, Naveen, and Mama Odie are painful to watch. Painful. \n\n7. They pretty much waste the best character and relationship in the story which is Tiana and Lottie. Swap out the story in the swamp and make Lottie involved. \n\n8. Give Naveen and the side characters some bigger character growth. \n\n9. The old guy pretending to be Naveen and hitting on Lottie is creepy. \n\n10. The movie really felt like a waste of time. What substantial things happened throughout the middle of the movie?\n\n11. They wasted Tiana\u2019s relationships with her mom too. Show more of her family dynamic. Lottie and Tiana and Tiana and her parents were the best part of the movie. \n\n12. Tiana seems too perfect. Give her more flaws to overcome and grow from instead of just sloppily making her challenge be becoming human again. Give us more depth to the story. \n\n13. The story lacks any real depth after they become frogs and is replaced by cheap comedy and gross frog content. \n\n14. They spend WAYYY too much time as frogs. It\u2019s drawn out. Make it so halfway through the movie or so they turn human again and it shows that Naveen was just using Tiana only for her to be kind to him when she finds this out. He\u2019ll leave but her kindness will stick with him and then he\u2019ll try to become a kinder person. Make it believable. Show us that kindness can really impact people and change lives. Not that he\u2019s being nice because he\u2019s forced to spend time with her. Have him get what he wants first and realize it isn\u2019t what he really wants. Have him go to cooking school or something and come back years later all so he could work for her because he wants to impact her life in the way she did his. I don\u2019t know. \n\n15. Voodoo is a real thing and it\u2019s scary. That stuff is not to be messed with and that\u2019s what makes it so scary as the villain\u2019s power; it\u2019s too real. Just like Frollo as a villain or Mother Gothel\u2019s gaslighting. \n\n16. It honestly just isn\u2019t interesting after they become frogs. The characters aside from Tiana and Lottie aren\u2019t compelling, the story is bland, the jokes are bad, the setting is dull, there\u2019s too much monotony and it feels like 75% at least of the movie is wasted on useless things. What makes a good Disney movie is if it appeals to all ages. I was 13 when this movie came out but it has never once appealed to me where as the majority of animated Disney movies do.\n\n17. I can understand the criticisms about Tiana being the first black princess and spending most of the movie as a frog. It looks kind of bad.",

People easily write Yoosung off because of his obsession with Rika when he\u2019s clearly depressed and grieving. It\u2019s a lack of empathy or understanding for his mental health, which would be one thing if it were just with him as a character, but it happens all the time in real life. A lot of people don\u2019t care one bit or don\u2019t care enough about other\u2019s mental health or the struggles and extreme concerns that mental health can and do cause. It\u2019s not taken seriously and that\u2019s a tragedy. People lose their lives because more people don\u2019t take it seriously or just don\u2019t understand. Just because you can\u2019t see it in the same way as you can with a physical illness doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be just as, or even more dangerous. I say this and feel so strongly about it because I almost lost my life to it. I didn\u2019t have support. I relate a lot to Yoosung, and while he\u2019s a fictional character I see this as an opportunity to spread awareness for mental health and to encourage people to be more compassionate about it. Just because someone may look fine doesn\u2019t mean they are. One of the worst things you can do is nothing. Just reach out and say how you care from time to time. Loving that person and staying by their side is what they need more than anything. So Jumin didn\u2019t stand by in 707\u2019s route. He took action. And that\u2019s what more people need in their lives. But I agree. \u263a\ufe0f I feel the same exact way as you. Yoosung was my first route as well!",

Eventually we could see growths forming on both sides of his face around his mouth so went to the vet and X-rays had shown tumours around his lower jaw and the bone there was essentially deteriorated away. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much they could do at that stage\u2026 could only prescribe medicine to keep him as comfortable as possible as he slowly got sicker and lost a lot of his weight from not being able to eat very well. Tried a liquid diet but that didn\u2019t last for long.. Had to have him put down as a mercy rather than watching him suffer and waste away. \n\nMy advice is it won\u2019t hurt to at least get it checked out.

Back then the humour and the fun, camaraderie-like elements of the series is what made me a fan.. Now years later the quality of the writing and worldbuilding is what kept me a fan.

If it\u2019s only 10 or 15% potency increase for tier 6 to 7 then maybe do physical/magical potency up instead. Just gotta find the best combinations overall from your gear.",

Think of it like AM radio > FM radio -  Older modems with older antennas could reach further, and were good for slow/moderate speeds.

Naruto.\n\nHeres my essay:\n\nOne piece is my personal favourite anime, and it also has the best world building and character development of the big 3. Oda will slip in little details early on that end up being a major piece of the puzzle hundreds of chapters/eps down the line and the connecting of the dots is a phenomenal experience. It also has the least filler and a lot of it is worth watching anyways, especially the G-8 arc. It\u2019s also the funniest and has the most emotional depth to it imo. As a 30+ man I\u2019ve cried from one piece multiple times and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it.\n\nI prefer Bleach over Naruto and the current thousand year blood war saga is pretty peak. Bleach is probably the most mature (at least now it is, maybe not always as one piece has some very dark moments) and Naruto is the least mature of the 3 if that helps. As an adult it might be hardest to get into Naruto as it\u2019s aimed for the youngest audience. Naruto feels pretty linear and doesn\u2019t really divert from a few major plot elements, some of the arcs feel insanely long and drawn out (I know saying that as a one piece fan feels weird but with Naruto it feels worse lol)\u2026 and yeah I don\u2019t know if Bleach ever had a main story \u201cgoal\u201d to be honest.. just disconnected story arcs partially connected by a villain later on.\n\nAll of the art is unique but bleach probably is the most detailed, and Naruto does have some truly great animated fight scenes.. one piece as the oldest had that 90s charm to the art early on which I always liked, and they improved it but maintained its style up until the time skip where it lost some of that charm.. but post-timeskip has its own great visuals too.\n\nIn rewatchability: \none piece - endlessly\nbleach - pretty easily\nNaruto - got bored\n\nAnd yeah, one piece is 1100+ episodes now.. but having watched most of them at least twice it\u2019s not hard at all to get through. You have plenty of time to watch them slowly since it\u2019s got a couple more years at least until it\u2019s done.. but once you start you\u2019ll probably end up binging it like most of us do and get through them all in no time anyways lol. Bleach took a 10 year break and just came back stronger in this current arc, pretty great stuff.. and Naruto is done. Fuck boruto, absolute trash.",

The buddy system testing ran for many hours, not just the 2 hours that separate the 2 screenshots... we were testing all sorts of things things like using summon animations to artificially extend \"bad\" runs so a buddy can swoop in and save the run/get the clear.. there was about a 12 hour difference in time between screenshot 2 and exploit discovery later on.\n\nthe exploit was discovered when a member mistakenly entered stage 5 instead of stage 4, and crashed/closed their game as an reaction to their mistake.. minutes passed where they were shown still participating so another member entered and cleared it. the first member then logged in and recovered their attempt.

If you don't realize how \"narrow minded\" you yourself are with your refusal to even consider any of the very true statements i've made, idk what to tell you.\n\nlet me put my viewpoint in as simple a nutshell as I can for you.\n\nA tank's main job is crowd control - which means holding hate, and staying alive while doing that. On top of that, they have to be able to read situations well.. like seeing how capable their dps are and be able to react quickly to situations of DPS/healers stealing hate.. And guess what? it's gonna happen! They're gonna lose hate! And it's part of the job, so get the hate back, and keep going, simple as that, cause it's... their... job...\n\na DPS's main job is to kill a pull as quickly and \"efficiently\" as possible, the way they do that varies by the size of the pull.. if they're doing area damage on big pulls they'll pull less hate on individual enemies but more overall, so then it's more for the tank to have to maintain across multiple targets.. Then single target damage should be used on small pulls or after most enemies in a large pull are dead, and that will pull more hate, and all of this should be a given. Should DPS also be using enmity reduction techniques? of course! - if they have them, but not all DPS have them, and they shouldn't under-perform to baby a tank that's not doing their job - unless it will LITERALLY KILL EVERYONE if they don't tone it down... which likely won't be the case.\n\nHealers... now healers... if you're of the mind that DPS taking damage will slow down a healer's ability to do damage themselves, I'll disagree.. The enemy's damage is being dealt regardless, it's just where it's being dealt that changes.. and that's what aoe heals are for since guess what? They created heals that hit multiple people! Imagine that! Apart from that.. not every healer likes to do damage themselves, and healing DPS just gives them more to do, which isn't really a bad thing...\n\nNow as I have this viewpoint, I'll tell you that I've played every job in the game to 60 and have a lot of experience in each role.. Am I perfect? No. Do my points have validity? Yes, and experience tells me that.. Disagree with me all you want but I do know what I'm doing. Usually I do take my mentor status a little more seriously than I did with this tank in this Qarn dungeon which we've gone horribly off topic from..  But it was just an obtuse p.o.s. who I didn't want to give the time of day to.. but hey, like I said I'm not perfect.\n\nWow... that \"simple nutshell\" ended up being pretty long.. meh.",

      "body": "Once again, disagree. The tanks may make the pulls but the DPS decide the pacing.. A pull could be small and over in a couple minutes with trash DPS, or a huge pull that lasts a few seconds with great dps.. it's entirely up to how effective the damage gets dealt in the party. The only pacing adjustments tanks do is in accordance with how effective their DPS are.\n\nNow tanking, or holding hate and how easy/hard that is, is affected by how good the DPS are, and tanks need to work harder to hold hate with good DPS. If i'm tanking and losing hate, then I'm happy, because that means my DPS are badass and i'm gonna work harder to hold hate, because once again, it's within a tank's means to do so and I know as a tank my damage is lower than the DPS' so I'll do my main job.. which is holding hate.\n\nYou talk about DPS stealing hate as if it's something that shouldn't be allowed/should be frowned upon.. All it really means is they're doing their job, and doing it better than the tank. And granted, for when these things happen DPS are given some degree of damage avoidance/mitigation themselves, and usually things work out fine. As long as I'm not dead I'll go balls out all I want and blame the tank for not doing their job, because my job is to kill things quickly-an enemy that's dead is an enemy that isn't hurting anyone, whether that's me if i have hate or the tank if they have hate. There is literally no excuse for one player to do less/play worse to accommodate another player who isn't performing, that's just silly.",

I didn't have time to wait for the tank to get good. The healer didn't do dps but that was fine, it kept everyone alive the whole dungeon, and kept me, a squishy dps alive as i tanked the last boss after the tank rage quit... Notice the other party member (yellow line) telling the tank to learn how to keep aggro... If that's not enough evidence that I wasn't the only one feeling the way I did in the party idk what else to tell you.\n\nI'm sick of this \"the tank is always right\" mentality that exists on practically all these forums... this is my first and last post in r/ffxiv.. \n\nedit- In addition to that... I completely disagree with you. If a dps steals hate that tank isn't doing their job... since it's not hard for GOOD tanks to maintain hate even when dps are going all out... Since ultimately pacing depends on DPS; the most effective damage dealers in the group... you know-DPS-\"Damage\" Per Second... whose effectiveness results in how fast things die... which makes healers have to heal less (more time for them to.. you guessed it, DPS!!!)... and do way more damage than tanks so Q.Q all you want but you better use flash more than 3 bloody times if you can't hold hate.... If this isn't obvious to you YOU need to go back to basics friend.\n\nP.S. I have this point of view as someone who spends equal time DPSing and tanking and I DO understand the roles... And you bet your arse I hold hate when I tank.",

Im sorry but the average grown person is not trying to sit through nothing but screaming and one movement happening over an episode. Dbz is great but its padding and old dub makes it unwatchable if you havent grown up with it imo. Kai is as perfect of a recut as you can get with all the action and story given to you, no breaks, no filler.",

The tutorial can be Steve Roger's training camp, where he is chosen. First mission will be killing the hydra agent who killed Dr. Selvig. And then you go to the European theatre, destroying one Hydra Base after the other. Exploring Europe, stealing Volkswagen, foiling one Hydra Project after another, getting upgrades from Stark, forming a 4 man team (multiplayer possibility) for missions etc. There is gunplay, shield play, a COD Ops type of game in a superhero setting.\n\nAnother is a personal fantasy of an open world RPG game based in mythological India, immediately after the Pandavas left the mortal realm. There are still godly powers there in the society and a lot of characters from Mahabharata are still active as kings and queens and royals. It can be a story that maybe explores the politics after the Mahabharata ended, or about proper disposal of mythological weapons like the Brahmastra and other weapons in the Mahabharata for preventing anyone to use it and knowledge to use it. Maybe prevent foreign attacks on kingdoms weakened by the great war in the north. You decide. And a small personal story of the character. Something like New Vegas and Skyrim set in Ancient India mythological kingdoms. You can see the magnificent Pandava palace, Dwarkadesh when it was all one, Gandhara, Magadha, Taxila and all ancient lands and universities and temples in their glory.",

She will hit the guys doesn't matter if they are the yonkai, greatest swordsman or whatever.

Always hiding her pain, acting composed but being clumsy and emotionally exposed and saving her smile for her closest friends.\n\nAnd so, so, so many characters.

Something like the start of LOTR, after the huge battle when Isildur does not throw the ring, but they still have peace. Can be start of a great story. But the story needs to dip into a Gilded world atleast.\n\nGilded world is the best setting for a story where you want a happy ending, bring the world to Heroic or even Noblebright. My favourite setting. Because even though it's bad, hope is still alive. And the hero needs to go through impossible odds and so much challenge to achieve their goals. There is no guarantee of success. No Deus ex machina. Just luck and hope and courage. You are actually invested, as it's a gamble. Either Heroic or Grimdark.\n\nGrimdark world. Abandon all hope who enter. Some lighthearted stories, lots of action.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee was humiliated on media regarding Kargil coffins which was confirmed to be non issue. Modi himself was termed Maut ka Saudagar, different media articles running inflammatory articles on him, taking each word spoken in the worst context possible, even though he was given a clean chit by the Supreme Court and the CBI SIT team, which grilled him for more than 8 hours. Meanwhile, literally no interviews for Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh or the future leader Rahul Gandhi, until Modi comes to power or if there, literally softball questions. Even the disastrous interview by Rahul Gandhi to Arnab, the questions were very softball questions. No agenda to them. Yet no one talks about that.\n\nI completely understand (though don't agree) why Modi is reluctant to give interviews. Throughout 90s and 2000s he has had a terrible experience with them with interviewers setting up traps and dangerous questions that answered anyway will result in someone getting riled up. Anything he said was used against him on the front page of the newspaper. That's why Modi developed the Social Media counter so he does not rely on biased media to spread his words and speeches. There used to be a time that whenever the PM went to foreign countries under Congress there used to be a media contingent that followed. All companies that ran media were from the Lutyens lobbies, that was primarily Congress based except 2 or 3 media houses that BJP had control over.\n\nNow BJP, staying in power for 3 elections has power over the media.

Do you know how brutal you have to be to horrify people who knew and worked in concentration camps. One battle is literally called the Rape of Nanjiang.

The struggles of females in this country is worse, but that does not mean that you can deny the problems male faces completely as well.\n\nThe rest I completely agree. The less stats, and men facing similar issues does not take away the fact that ladies do in fact face a terrible time in society. Being stared at, and some scum doing even worse things.

Chinese through a century of misery was able to purge all its old institutions, while India had to dismantle them slowly, a process still going on today as well. Modern China had one great leader, Deng Xiaoping rule continuously for 20 years, following Mao Zedong, who was a mixed bag, doing a lot of good but at great cost. India has had more than 10 prime ministers, each with their own agenda and direction of development. The British rule permeated through entire of India, religious divide between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Chinese had just the coastal areas attacked by foreign powers in coastal areas.\n\nIndia has done remarkably well I believe as a major democracy. Name one another major democracy with a large indigenous population who might have done even remotely as well as India. China, as much of a success story it has, I believe will face challenges regarding power transition. Any oligarchy has that problem. I believe centralized power is amazing and can transform any nation into a superpower **GIVEN** the leader is competent. And Deng Xiaoping was a dream leader by any standards, aided by a failing Soviet Union on its border and zero invasions and revolutions from within and without. India has had its share of inept leaders, Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi in her latter half, Moraji Desai who squandered all the good work done by other leaders. Also constantly fighting insurgency in north and east almost during its entire existence.\n\nScrew mentality. India has always struggled with lack of resources. Don't forget, India has been a protectionist state (even after liberalization, though it did reduce the scope) along with also given half of the budget at its Independence. Lack of Energy security (oil resources), reservation and so many other things have always led India to face an uphill battle. But it does so with the will of its people. All decisions have been made through representative powers and compromises. That's why even though we have so, so many problems so many people have profound love for this nation of ours. Because even the most horrible decisions have been made by prime ministers voted in by us. It's the responsibility of the voters.\n\nNow to mentality. Despite the serious lack of resources India has consistently punched above it's weight. Despite the largest population in the entire world, as a percentage we are doing average, which is a huge achievement. We have 1 policeman for 100000 people. Way worse than the next best. Despite that most of the areas except Eastern India is pretty safe.\n\nThat's my rant regarding the topic.",

It's because of the shunting of profits and revenues to that small group of people. But unless government resolves the debt situation and starts spending millions of taxpayer dollars for infrastructure development, within 2 decades civilian development won't be good, and same for the economy. Current US economy is built on strong domestic spending and infrastructure development by past presidents. But wars and global platform based funding have depleted funds. There is a trillion dollar debt. It will require a decrease in government spending. Austerity measures have been done by so, so many countries.

I think the past covered by the manwha till now was the amazing part. But for me the most important thing is how the story ends. How everything ties up together. ORV has a shitty ending. Solo Leveling has a good ending. That's it. So if you're going to read the manwha, just think about this. \n\nThe other manwha/webnovel I was talking about is **The Novel's Extra**. So the story follows a novelist whose novel is not popular and he is on hiatus. But his story is made in the real world, and he is thrown in that world as an extra character. He starts interacting with characters he has written himself about, and starts getting attached to those characters. The combat is so goddamn amazing, as the protagonist is a gun wielding badass in an age of magical swords and bows. He just wields guns, shotguns and sniper rifle to take out people like deadshot. It's so much fun. The best parts are combat and character interaction. Honestly I was expecting ORV to be similar, but as time goes by it just falls so much short of The Novel's Extra, especially in the last arc. It doesn't do a good job of tying everything up.",

It was a drag to get through the end chapters. So much exposition. On the other hand Solo Leveling had a way more simple to understand premise, and was just good solid action and relation between characters. \n\nBTW, screw both of them. The best in this genre is none of them, it's definitely **A Novel's Extra**. The character relationship is just so good, and the last arc though the weakest, delivers an amazing ending. And man the gun based action is just so goddamn sweet. I believe it's the best novel in same genre as Solo Leveling and ORV. I have ready it 3 times and it's still so fun.

      "body": "Great arguments all around. But there are some reasons why I believe in supporting Imperials:\n\n- If Skyrim can break away from the empire, the reach can break away from Skyrim. Unlike what people think, Skyrim is not united under the Nords. There are the Reach guys who had a whole complicated plot for freedom. And it wouldn't stop under Drafonborn or Upfric alone. And this whole mess was Ulfric's fault in the first place. The Reach's situation shows why a free Skyrim under Upfric Stormcloak, might be an issue. Who knows, there might be another revolution under him, as if he can overthrow the high king, so can he be overthrown.\n\n- Skyrim's economic situation. Yes, many people have mentioned how attacking Skyrim is hard, but it can be easily be economically throttled. Who are they gonna trade with? The Solstheim issue between Nords and dark elves, the racism and recent war with Imperials make the whole Skyrim province isolated. A frigid north which is isolated makes prices and inflation go up. There are literally only two areas with farming capacity, whiterun and riften. Trading is done under the Empire's trade fleet, so they need to build their own fleet to trade and defend from naval attacks.\n\n- The White Gold Concordat is not just a tool to build gap between Skyrim and Empire. They are genuine terms that High Elves believe in. They don't consider Talos, a human to be a god, as they believe elves are superior. So they will enforce and battle Skyrim. Many people are mentioning how Hammerfall defended itself, but they forget, that the Aldmeri Dominion had no clue they could be so successful. They wanted to conquer Khaljit provinces, and fight Hammerfall. But they reached Cyrodill too soon. They literally had no idea regarding the logistics. And then they were dealt a heavy blow in Cyrodill by the imperial army. And the war ended with the White Gold Concordat signed. So Aldmeri Dominion ended war on a loss, got a treaty which contains and achieves their main goals. It's like a fighter got sucker punched but the opponent surrendered. Why wouldnyou want to continue the fight. Aldmeri Dominion is not interested in Hammerfall by itself that's why when the the resistance began, High elves destroyed Hammerfall, but retreated. They had already won. Their enemy was The Empire, not Hammerfall. That's why no reinforcements.\n\n- And finally for all of Titus Mede's fallacy, one thing is for sure. He'll be gone by the end of the game. Either deposed or assassinated. So there will be a new ruler. So things might change. And the empire is against the white gold Concordat as well. And against the admeri dominion. Never did they execute ban on Talos worshippers. It was Thalmor ambassadors. So it's better to fight the common enemy. The bigggest reason for Skyrim to revolt is that Skyrim lives were lost defending the empire. Well,.if the empire had lost, Skyrim would definitely be next. AS that is the place of Thalos. Aldmeri Dominion would not have let them go.",

The most difficult part of the fight hands down have to be the stone gargoyles. **HE RESUMMONS THEM**, so you can just keep attacking them and it will never end.

She does not have anything that excels, her heat smash sucks ass, she has a bad hellsweep in comparison to the other mishimas and no other low besides that. To top all of that off she is one of the most linear characters in existence with very bad homing moves.\n\nShe is quite literally one of the easiest to counter characters, if you lab her and know what to do. Its not even hard to lab her. The Problem is that some people don't lab her, go get fkd by good players and then go on to stream about how stupid and broken she is.

Many of those streamers, with hundreds of viewers, have been there a while are dependent upon those sales. They are, in fact, resellers. I often avoided them unless there was a giveaway I could win or something like that. The key thing is knowing what you want and knowing its price. When streaming, or watching always have your computer and phone with you to have tcgplayer up so you don't get ripped off and if you're in a bidding war know where to stop where you're actually saving because shipping can still hurt. Also, avoid any huge giveaways, like a PS5, Ferrari (yes, I've seen that before), etc. because you're going to end up wasting a lot of money, win or lose\n\nEdit: Tl;dr: Know what you want, and don't buy into gimmicks",
