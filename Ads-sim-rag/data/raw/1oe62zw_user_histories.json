Dir gehts also um meine Formulierung, nicht um meine Standpunkte selbst, verstehe ich das Richtig?\n\nIch pers\u00f6nlich finde es extrem, was in Amerika abgeht, und das ist f\u00fcr mich deutlich gef\u00e4hrlicher, bzw. \"extremer\" als das, was ich geschrieben habe. Aberich kann genauso in die Tiefe eintauchen:\n\nWenn ich frage: \"Warum sollte man sich Kommentare zu irgendwem verkneifen?\", dann ist das in erster Linie mal eine Nachfrage zur Aussage, die ich im Verlauf mit Argumenten untermauert habe. Argumente waren, dass Amerika sich selbst oft als \"Land of freedom\" bezeichnet und besonders die Meinungsfreiheit hoch anrechnet. Trump selbst ist ja ganz krass gegen sog. \"Fake News\", Plattformen machen sich stark gegen sog. \"Zensur\", also werden Holocaustrelativierungen einfach akzeptiert usw. Ist ja alles \"nur\" deren Meinung. Wenn ich mir diese Argumente vornehme und anwende und es offen dar stelle, ist das nicht extrem. Vielleicht nicht so sachlich wie ein Tagesschau-Beitrag formuliert, das Argument steht aber weiterhin und wurde bisher auch nicht entkr\u00e4ftigt, sondern der Kommentar als Gesamtes mit \"extremer Denkensweise\" bewertet.\n\nWer in einen faschistischen Staat reist und das nicht bedenklich findet, welche Beweggr\u00fcnde auch immer, wissend, was da abgeht, ist halt selbst schuld, um nicht \"peinlich\" zu verwenden. Klar, ist meine Ansicht, aber sollte doch jede:r so denken, der/ die sich an Freiheit und Demokratie erfreut. Alleine schon, dass dein Handy gecheckt wird, ob du irgendwelche Memes von Vance drauf hast, und dir deswegen sogar die Einreise verwehrt wird, ist ein Eingriff in die pers\u00f6nliche Freiheit und den Datenschutz, der nicht nachvollziehbar und unverh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig ist. Wer da aus moralischer Sicht keine Bedenken hat , oder trotz alldem dahin reist, der ist an seiner Situation einfach selbst schuld. Du kannst doch nicht nach Dubai reisen und dort den Scheich kritisieren, und die USA sind auf bestem Wege dahin, genau so ein autokratisches Superreichen-Emirat zu werden. Jegliche Relativierung davon ist mit der Realit\u00e4t unvermeidbar, und das ist nicht extrem ausgedr\u00fcckt, sondern den Tatsachen entsprechend. Egal was f\u00fcr Umst\u00e4nde es sind, in meinen Augen gibt es keinerlei Gr\u00fcnde, dorthin zu reisen. Berufliche Verpflichtung? Lehn den Auftrag ab wegen deiner eigenen Sicherheit; Kann ja sein, dass du von ICE entf\u00fchrt wirst oder dich n Cop \u00fcber den Haufen ballert. Familie? Kann auch nach Deutschland reisen, dort ist man sicherer, und zur Not gibt's Videocalls.\n\nDieses Land verscheppt t\u00e4glich Tausende US-B\u00fcrger:Innen, und andere Menschen, die in den USA sind und ggf. einer Arbeit nachgehen. Es werden Armeecorps in St\u00e4dte geschickt, um die Zivilbev\u00f6lkerung zu terrorisieren. Bereits 2018 gab es auf 326.00.000 Einwohner:Innen in den USA \u00fcber 393.000.000 Waffen, also mehr Knarren als Einwohner:Innen. Sozial-schwache Menschen werden systematisch zum Existenzminimum bishin zur Existenzaufgabe gedr\u00e4ngt, Menschen sterben, weil der Autokrat Trump ihnen die Hilfe gestrichen hat. Man kann mittlerweile ruhigen Gewissens die Vereinigten Staaten mit den Anf\u00e4ngen des dritten Reichs vergleichen (NICHT Gleichsetzen, das ist n Unterschied).\n\nAbsolut nichts an meinen Positionen oder meinen Kommentaren ist extrem. Extrem ist es, was Trump mit dem Land anstellt, und ich finde es auch extrem bedenklich, wenn man das so herunterspielt, als w\u00e4re die USA eine weitere x-beliebige Nation wie Schweden oder Griechenland oder so. Nein, die USA sind ein imperialistischer, faschistischer, autokratischer Staat, wo der Aufenthalt sack gef\u00e4hrlich ist, nicht nur vom gesellschaftlichen, sondern auch dank Trump insbesondere von politischer Seite.\n\nMich interessiert aber, wie du das siehst. Ich bin offen f\u00fcr Diskussionen und erweitere meine Meinung st\u00e4ndig weiter und lade dich hiermit explizit ein, einen Beitrag dazu zu leisten. :)",

Mich interessiert bei einem Rapper mehr, was er wie zu sagen hat, und nicht, wie jemand die T\u00f6ne trifft oder singen kann, oder wie jemand anderes besonders virtuos ein Instrument spielen kann. Ich h\u00f6r selbst neben Rap jegliche Art von Metal, ich feier auch sowas. Ich vergleichs mal so: wenn ich Lorna Shore h\u00f6re, will ich von Will Ramos angeschrien werden, wenn da Will Ramos steht.\n\nDen Rapper macht den Inhalt seiner Texte aus, es macht ihn erst authentisch. Wenn ein Rapper nichts zu sagen hat und deswegen sich seine Texte schreiben l\u00e4sst, dann ist er auf nem Level wie Kontra K.\n\nAber ich bin auch im deutschen acapella Battlerap bewandert, dort gab es mal ein Turnier, wo es unter anderem auch ein Ghostwriter-Battle gab. Das war sehr unterhaltsam und erm\u00f6glicht Angles und Pointen, die sonst nicht m\u00f6glich w\u00e4ren. Als Show super, keine Frage, aber als rappender Musiker, wo die Authentizit\u00e4t der Texte erst das besondere ist, fraglich.",

Das Problem ist, dass im aktuellen system kein Platz f\u00fcr arbeitswillige Menschen mit besonderen Bed\u00fcrfnissen existiert, wie bspw. Menschen mit Autismus, oder anderen Krankheiten, die einen am Arbeiten hindern, wie Depressionen. Und ich kann verstehen, dass man nicht seine Lebenszeit f\u00fcr Mindestlohn verschwenden will, wenn die Stelle nicht zu deinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen passt. Problem ist, dass das Gesundheitssystem ebenfalls marode as fuck ist und einen mit Wartezeiten, Fachkr\u00e4ftemangel etc zerm\u00fcrbt. Entsprechend haben viele Menschen keine Diagnose, z\u00e4hlen aber dennoch als Totalverweigerer.\n\nNebenbei, die Zahl der Totalverweigerer betr\u00e4gt 420. 420 Menschen in Deutschland, wegen denen ein unertr\u00e4glicher aufschrei seit Monaten zelebriert wird. Und nochmal: diese Menschen WOLLEN sich gerne einbringen, aber eben nicht unter den Bedingungen und Voraussetzungen, die aktuell da sind. Das sind ganz individuelle F\u00e4lle, die allesamt mit Entgegenkommen, Zuversicht und Hilfe gel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnten, wenn man denn nur will.\n\nEin jeder Mensch sehnt sich nach Zuneigung, nach Best\u00e4tigung, nach Gesellschaft und Mitmenschen. Wirklich, jeder, das ist Teil der menschlichen Natur und der Evolution. Logisch geht sowas mit Arbeit gut, aber Arbeit ist in unserer Gesellschaft nur dann Arbeit, wenn sie Geld bringt. Das kann einfach nicht jede:r, entsprechend ist unser Sozialsystem eine gute Sache, um diese Menschen nicht sterben zu lassen. Denn was w\u00e4re die Alternative? Arbeitszwang, aka Sklaverei? Streichen der Hilfeleistungen,was gegen das Grundgesetz w\u00e4re und dazu f\u00fchrt, dass diese Menschen einfach verrecken? Geil. Und als Konsequenz tritt man weiter runter auf die, denn die haben ja nichts und k\u00f6nnen sich nicht wehren.\n\nSo geht Klassenkampf nicht. Du bist in deiner Position n\u00e4her an einem Sozialhilfeempf\u00e4nger dran, als an einem Milliard\u00e4r. Dabei sind diese Milliard\u00e4re die eigentlichen Totalverweigerer, gehen nicht arbeiten, zahlen kaum steuern, betr\u00fcgen sogar nicht selten und f\u00f6rdern mit ihrem Lebensziel die drohende Klimakatastrophe. Arbeitslose, Arbeitssuchende, sog. \"Totalverweigerer\" sind kein Problem f\u00fcr uns als Gesellschaft. Das Problem sind die Menschen, die Spalten wollen (alles rechts der SPD) und Superreiche Menschen, die ihr Verm\u00f6gen ungerechterweise angeh\u00e4uft haben und die Arbeiterklasse nichts davon g\u00f6nnen.
