    "they are slightly different and excell at different things.\n\nXTX got higher vram capacity so in the future will age slightly better, it got superior software (Adrenaline vs control panel) and there are some games where it beats the 4080 and even approaches the 4090 in raster.\n\nthe 4080 are stronger in ray tracing, got superior features such as a better upscaler and AI and content creation things (Through, the xtx are perfectly fine at a hobby level) \n\nimho the physical design of the 4080 are also superior in terms of thingsl ike temperature, but the xtx are superior in not having the 12 pin connector, are physically smaller and got superior connections.\n\n  \nAt the same price it is generally recommended a 4080 unless you are very focused on one or two games and those games happen to be where the xtx excell.\n\n  \notherwise my personal point where i start to recommend the xtx over the 4080 is when the 4080 is more than 150 dollars more expensive",
