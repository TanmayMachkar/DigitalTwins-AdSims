    "I enjoy it, but I can't claim I was blown away by it. It won't be making my top 10 any time soon.",
    "Lucy",
    "She's a joke.",
    "Ugh. What is this design? It's so busy and ugly.",
    "What kills me is people claiming he took that ice spike to the heart. He took it in his right shoulder. How badly did these people flunk biology that they think their heart is in their right shoulder?",
    "As someone that doesn't watch the show, I gotta be honest, I did not immediately realize this was supposed be a sex scene.  Nobody looks like their enjoying themselves here. I was trying to figure out what this was supposed to be until I read the comments.",
    "I don't know what this is....why did this show up in my recommendations?",
    "I find it more confusing that he just sat there and let it happen.",
    "Goblin Slayer",
    "I couldn't even get through book 1. It was bad enough that the author kept skipping over character and relationship building moments, then the story started escalating in dumber and dumber ways, and I just said, \"Nope. We're done here.\"",
    "Andrea Parsneau, Jeff Hayes, Mark Thompson, Travis Baldree, and Dick Hill",
    "One Piece. Every time.",
    "Primal Hunter and Azerinth Healer, easily. I love Travis Baldree. I love Andrea Parsneau. Even their narrations can't keep me invested.",
    "A picture of Fern floating in the air, ready to murder a bitch.",
    "Azerinth Healer because the numbers are utterly meaningless. Main character can 1v1 an opponent 60 levels higher than her with barely any damage. Why even have a leveling system if you're going to ignore it?",
    "Fuck it, I'm taking 3. I'm not Yuno's obsession, so she won't bother me, Frieren would be chill and there's only about 5% chance that Makima will have enough interest to kill me. Everywhere else would either have jumping out of the plane myself or getting shot by Revy for sneezing in her direction. Every other spot that has someone I like is bordered with someone I want nothing to do with for I am petty.",
    "Osborne was a lame villain. He has the same issue I have with Aizen, where we're simply told that everything that happens was all part his grand plan and people are way too easily swayed by him despite having the charisma of dead tree branch. I just don't buy that he's the great machiavellian schemer he was built up as or that  anybody would go along with him.",
    "Jinshi likes his women fun-sized.",
    "Kimura, hands down. She's essentially the mascot of all Laura's suffering from childhood to the present. Kimura is the very monster they tried to turn Laura into.",
    "Konosuba. I've tried on 3 separate occasions to watch it, and each time was torture.",
    "Ye be fucked",
    "1 or 7, I think.",
    "Shrek. The others have stuff I genuinely enjoy, I do not care about Shrek save for maybe 2 lines from the first movie.",
    "I haven't touched it since finishing book 4. If I'm being honest, I don't really care about seeing the MC back on Earth again, and no part of his family drama has changed that opinion. Especially with him only *now* reflecting on the people he's killed. That should have come up a lot sooner.",
    "Bitches! and also Jinx is here",
    "Honestly, she's just kinda overrated in general. If she didn't have big titties I doubt anyone would remember her at all.",
    "Good Morning World from Dr. Stone. It's so beautifully iconic.",
    "Probably the first one. I can't imagine evil Jesus is gonna particularly interested in me, I don't have anything Moeka would kill me over, and Nejire and Frieren would be fun to talk to. The biggest troublemaker would probably be Ceasar, but as soon as he acts up, Frieren's just gonna bully him until he shuts up or probably shove him in a bottle for funsies. Number 4 would probably be my next choice.",
    "Books specifically? 291. Currently. I have a few series that are still ongoing and a few others I'm interested in checking out.",
    "https://preview.redd.it/5t63eewetbue1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fad84d757ea9d00d54990f56c871e7fdc5896f4\n\nGonna be honest, I'm not even sure what that shot in the original post is. Is it supposed to be Superman?",
    "She's killed one. With a lucky shot while he was distracted.",
    "Eh. There are worse ways to go. And that's assuming she's has any interest in killing me.",
    "By my experience, he throws a tantrum every time one of his waifus gets insulted. I get liking a character, but he takes it too far. He'll start banging on about them on posts that have nothing to do with them and get pouty when someone tells him to drop it. I once commented on a cute picture of Agnes, and he jumped in just to bang on about Elaine out of nowhere.",
    "I'm too old, so none. Not that I'm terribly heartbroken in this instance. I like 5 of these girls, but knowing my luck, I'd probably get one of the other 7.",
    "Same.",
    "Dub. I like to be able to do other things while cutscenes play if I need to, whether it's making myself food, grabbing a drink, or whatever. I generally just prefer the english voices, so it works out pretty well.",
    "Makima. She doesn't have any reason to give a damn about killing me, and her power is literally controlling anything she views as beneath her. I'll take my chances with her, especially if we have a mutual interest.",
    "I'll take J. Probably the least likely to make me hate life.",
    "Full Metal Alchemist (Brotherhood and the other one). Bleach. Naruto. The Eminence in Shadow. Re:Zero. High School of the Dead. High School DxD. Tokyo Revengers. Konosuba. JJK after Shibuya. Chainsaw Man. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.  Attack on Titan. Death Note. Kakeguruii. But especially Attack on Titan.",
    "Any author who's willing to listen to and accept criticism will only improve their craft. Like I said, there's a lot of good stuff in Rune Seeker, and I'm sure there are more good ideas swimming around your head. It would be criminal not to contribute to your growth as a writer, even if it's just sharing my own point of view. I look forward to seeing more of your work and wish you only the best.",
    "I stopped at the end of book 2. To be fair, there are several things about the series I like. The various power sets are interesting and fun, they're fairly well balanced, and Hiral isn't so obscenely overpowered (despite what Yannily says) that the other characters are unnecessary. The rest of the cast doesn't exist just to marvel at how great Hiral is, or just exist to be added to a harem. They actually serve a purpose in battle and are their own people. The world building is solid and the nebulous \"enemy\" is a potent and persistent threat with ways all it's own to raise the stakes.\nUnfortunately where it fell apart for me is the story's inability to stop and breath. The first book is a solid start, but book 2 just doesn't stop. Too much action means less time engaging the characters and expanding on who they are, and book 2 felt like a nonstop action sequence. Fight some battles, race to the next dungeon while fighting monsters, rinse and repeat until boss fight occurs. The near nonstop fighting became more of a tedious chore than exciting or engaging and by the time I got to the end, I just didn't care about them fighting the big boss.\nI feel too much action can detrimental as too little in these stories and Rune Seeker just had way too much. I finished Book 2 but I find that I'm burned out on the series. I can't bring myself to pick up book 3, even though I would like to see more of characters power sets and learn more about the world and characters.",
    "No. I got the final dungeon and never picked it up again.",
    "To be a punchline",
    "Hey, now. That's insulting. At least Saturday morning cartoon villains were entertaining.",
    "I'll be honest with you, I don't care about anything in JJK past the Shibuya incident (the arc the anime just finished). It turns into a lot of introducing characters just to murder them unceremoniously. One of the main villains is essentially defeated by a dude who has no meaningful connection to him whatsoever and then gets beheaded immediately after the fight.",
    "And yet, the most consistent theme before the time-skip was hard work overcoming talent. Then Kishimoto realized that Naruto was a slacker who never studied and had to be taught what the power system was from an 8 year old while having a demon fox inside of him that allowed him to brute force his way out of trouble every time he screwed up. Kinda had to change the theme when the MC doesn't embody it in the slightest.",
    "Jaune. The story can't even make up its mind about him, yet his fans will meat ride him into the sunset while pretending he deserves the hype the series piles onto him.",
    "I'm gonna Mami, only because her life's mission seems to be making Kazuya miserable, and I am all for that.",
    "Well, I literally just watched Lycoris Recoil, and I'm not a terrorist or a criminal, so I'm fine. I'm not even in Japan, so my life won't change in the slightest.",
    "Bocchi chest was never that prominent in her usual outfits, though. She deliberately wears baggy clothes all the time and is usually hunched in on herself, so the only time anyone even noticed was when she had the maid outfit on and when they went to the beach.",
    "This. She's a pointless addition to the cast and contributes nothing outside of combat. She has no relationship with anyone but Van, and even that's barely there, and she doesn't develop a connection to anyone in the main group. She just exists and takes up space.",
    "Meh. It looks nice, but that's about it.",
    "God no. He's barely even a strategist. His first supposed \"plan\" with the deathstalker stinger wasn't even his idea. It was Ren's. Every idea he's had since then has only worked because RT deemed it so. When they even remember he's supposed to be \"the strategist\" and don't just have Ruby come up with the plan.",
    "Cyborg, probably. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Cyborg insisted on teaching her while making up some not at all convincing excuse.",
    "Salem wins. The end. Or, team RWBY are held accountable for their many crimes and locked up, while people who are actually qualified to deal with this mess ensure they can't make things worse anymore.",
    "To each their own. I hated Rean's ever expanding harem that encompasses every girl in his vicinity. It just got too ridiculous after a while and took attention away from other characters that didn't get enough development. It got to a point where I was just rolling my eyes every time a new addition to the harem got added. But, that's my opinion.",
    "Log Horizon. I tried to watch for a couple of friends who recommended it, hated every minute. It was tedious, and all the characters are morons. The main character only seems intelligent because he got most of the one braincell everyone had to share.",
    "Everything. I love Kajun, she's my favorite character and her design is immaculate.\u00a0",
    "No, I just have trouble finding something to read in general. I have to be in the proper mood for any kind of story. There are exceptions, books I like so much I can go through whenever I feel like it, but they are few and far between. Even right now, I'm struggling to find something that holds my attention because I'm not sure what I want to listen to.",
    "Esdeath. I get it. She's hot and she has big titties. She's still a sadistic killer who tortures her enemies until they're mentally broken and willingly works for a corrupt government just so can be as sadistic and cruel as she wants. There has to be a point where being attractive doesn't excuse being a terrible person.",
    "Force sensitivity by itself would be enough for me. That alone could cover half of these options with the various ways the Force can be used.",
    "It is unearned. It's CRWBY trying to push the idea that the protagonists didn't make everything worse at every turn and ignoring all of the problems they dumped on everyone else.",
    "\"You're end will not be peaceful nor quick.\"",
    "It fills me with an unquenchable desire to destroy....",
    "The Wandering Inn Garden of Sanctuary. Really hoping Pirateaba doesn't have a messed up sense of humor because it's scheduled to drop on April 1st.",
    "I'll take the clone of me, please. No way in hell am I beating my dad in his prime. I'm a gamer nerd. He's a sports boy that used to get into fights.",
    "No. None of the Simpsons are worthy. Part of the joke in Simpsons is that they're all terrible and selfish in their own ways. Lisa is no exception.",
    "Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon. I don't recall which one I saw first, but I used to watch SM before going to school every morning as a kid and Dragonball Z after school.",
    "It's still a cheap way to escalate the situation that's completely unnecessary. Goblins going around destroying villages and slaughtering the innocent is enough to get across why they should be hated and feared.",
    "This. Making the goblins evil pillaging monsters was enough reason to hate them. The rape is just pointlessly excessive.",
    "https://preview.redd.it/hir15jahuace1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1b79403e5c52027a80a380bb840a97abc9432c5\n\nWelp, I guess I'm living in a hut and dealing with these weirdos from now on. Could be worse.",
    "She spends too long never learning from her mistakes. Whether people want to admit it or not, Ruby's desire to play hero has done more harm than good on more than one occasion. She see's Cinder breaking sneaking around during the dance, but rather than go alert the adults she gets her weapon so she can save the day, only to accomplish nothing and fail to recognize Cinder despite her only disguise being that stupid domino mask. She hides things from Ozpin and Ironwood so that her team can go fight the White Fang, resulting in them crashing the train into Vale which she and her team failed utterly to stop. They declare this blatant failure a success and just assume that's the end of it. She tries to confront Roman only to get her ass kicked, first by Neo, then by Roman and Neo, then just by Roman because she's horribly outclassed and is too dumb to see it. After being completely humiliated by Roman and having to be saved by a Grimm of all things, she decides to set out to find the people responsible, while never once reflecting on how badly she got beat or putting in any effort to improve herself. She and JNR get attacked by Tyrian who they are completely helpless against. The man takes them apart while toying with them and even supercharging Nora does jack shit to improve the odds as he effortlessly blocks her attack. Has to be saved by Qrow, only to incessantly interfere in the fight and make things worse, resulting in Qrow getting poisoned. Then, when Ozpin suggests that they need more training she stupidly states \"we already know how to fight\" completely ignoring all the times she got her ass beat. Never mind Roman and  Neo, the four of them couldn't handle just one member of Salem's inner circle when he was just playing with them. It's just a long, long list of fuck ups and she never learns from any of them. She is willfully ignorant of her own shortcomings to the point that it borders on being arrogance. Then, when CRWBY finally address all these things, the answer is apparently drink the tea that kills you. She's a mess and the writers clearly had no idea what to do with her beyond validating her childish world-view.",
    "I don't really like care about any of the Toy Story sequels. Not a one.",
    "I like the first one a lot. Despite the environmentalist angle, it actually acknowledges the positive advancement of technology and a how it effects the daily lives of certain people. It understands that, while they need a less harmful alternative, that's something that takes time. There's no magical insta-fix to their problems, they have to work towards it. The second one I don't think is bad, but it does have problems. Not least of which is how much of a downer it can be.",
    "Hey, at least that one only hurts you. No need to drag other people into the downward spiral.",
    "Not humiliate myself in public because the girl I paid to make me feel good about myself did the same for other guys, like it's her job to do. Not stalk said girl like a creep or daydream about getting cucked. Not lie like I breathe and corner the same girl into going along with my lies and then pile on more lies. Literally everything. This moron is a walking disaster and a restraining order waiting to happen. In fact, if I woke up as Kazuya, I might end it all right there. Just remove him from the gene pool completely. I root for Mami whenever she comes around to ruin his life, because he deserves it. Every bit of it.",
    "https://i.redd.it/x4fvb19s2hbe1.gif\n\nThat's quite a few of them actually, but in recent memory I'd say Heartcatch Precure. This isn't the full scene, but the two mascot characters ran into the mc (literally) while running away and in a panic dove down her shirt to hide. It's silly, but that along with the villains' reaction to seeing her did make me laugh. I honestly think it's a little funnier that this is not indicative of the shows sense of humor. This is the only time I've seen thus far that they make a boob joke so the fact that it's so out of place makes it a bit more effective.",
    "D. I'm indifferent to VI, and I have zero interest in XVI, but I love 8 and tactics, so I can replay those to my hearts content.",
    "Hard for stakes to exist when the mc can just stop time and casually murder everyone. Ainz is too powerful, and watching him easy mode his way through everything while making the people opposing him either complete scumbags or absolute morons doesn't help.",
    "Ditto",
    "Couldn't get into it. Some fun fights here or there, but I can't say I care about the outcome.",
    "Same",
    "I had a friend show me Overlord thinking I'd love it and was disappointed when I found it boring.",
    "I enjoy it up until.Sibuya ends. Everything after that is horrible.",
    "I don't card for it either",
    "Konosuba. Can't stand it. They drive their jokes into the ground. Getting through episode 1 alone was a chore, and nothing from the series has ever gotten a laugh out of me.",
    "Morrowind. I didn't like Oblivion and could never get into it. I enjoyed Skyrim, but not so much the main story. With Morrowind, I enjoy the exploration, the setting,  and the main plot is genuinely interesting, especially Dagoth Ur.",
    "Harem. Harem every single time until the end of time. I can find humor in a woman looking way younger than she actually is, but I'm so far beyond tired of low effort harems where the hero gets every girl in existence by virtue of being the protagonist despite being either a terrible person or the most boring individual who ever lived.",
    "Goblin Slayer, Grimgar, and Log Horizon are all shows I would have happily dropped after episode 1 if I hadn't been watching them with/for other people.",
    "That you don't have a specific type",
    "Terrible. Natsu is irresponsible and impulsive with no patience for negotiations. Any kingdom he rules would collapse in a week unless Lucy is there is reign him in, and even then, if she's actually running the country, she wouldn't have time to babysit him.",
    "Not really. It would have been too much if she had actually beaten Pakku, a master that's both trained and the best in the North Pole. That would've been unreasonable. Katara got good through live combat because she had to. Even then, she was frustrated with Aang being more naturally talented than her. She taught herself enough and fought enough to be above average, but Pakku's instruction helped her fine tune her technique and gave her the direction she needed to become great.",
    "Delicious In Dungeon",
    "Spirit Tracks. It's a genuinely fun game, Zelda is a constant companion and she's adorable and hilarious, and I never hear anyone talk about it.",
    "Fight Club. My sister obsessed over it, my friends love it, but I can't stand it. I hate the main character with every fiber of my being, and the story was atrocious. I returned it to the friend who let me borrow the same day, 10 minutes after I was done with it, just to be rid of it.",
    "As strong as Clare gets, she's losing this fight. She has nothing to counter Excalibur or Avalon. She would have to kill Saber with one attack to avoid Avalon's regeneration, and I don't see that happening when Saber can avoid Tsubame Gaeshi. Just barely,  true, but even Clare's fastest attack isn't that fast.",
    "Naruto and Bleach.",
    "I have no earthly idea who this is or why I keep seeing them everywhere",
    "Likely because he validated her actions rather than point out how fucked up they are. Connor called her out and refused to let it slide. She wanted someone that told her she was in the right.",
    "Honestly, if you throw him into RWBY, even with no aura, he'd probably beat everyone's ass.",
    "I'm walking straight up to Olivier and asking if I can work for him so I'll never be bored again. I will follow that man to hell and back because he'll somehow make it hilarious and brilliant. Besides that, I'm having tea with Risette. Or adopting Altina.",
    "But he will anyway. Then shove it down everyone throats on posts that have nothing to do with her in the slightest. Yet, gets butthurt whenever someone refuses enable this nonsense or calls her boring.",
    "It's not. Her boobs are pressed into his back, that's all. She wasn't groping or trying to strip him. She was holding down, and nothing she was saying was even remotely sexual. Dear lord, people really don't know what sexual assault is do they?",
    "Because this wasn't assault? Officially speaking, even if he didn't know it was Toga, this was a competition and they were opponents. She didn't grope him, she didn't try to tear his clothes off, she didn't even say anything sexual, she just held him down. The worst thing you can say she did is that her boobs were pressed into back, making him flustered, but that's not exactly enough to cry assault over. She was literally just holding him down and asking questions. Mabaraho's blonde chick forcing the mc down and stripping against his will is assault. Ryoko trapping Tenchi in a cave and trying to force herself on him is assault. At worst, this is maybe harassment?",
    "Absolutely. Dr Stone is so good, and the characters are so much fun.",
    "He wouldn't be any less of a creep, he'd just also be directing his perversion at himself.",
    "I love Frieren, don't get me wrong, but I absolutely adore Marcille. She's so much fun.",
    "Post-beacon, Yang is a massive hypocrite. She gets mad at everyone else for lies and anything she perceives as a betrayal of trust, but she still refuses to tell anyone that she knows Raven is a maiden and didn't think twice about going behind Ironwood and Ruby's backs, then has the audacity to act like everyone else is in the wrong but her. She's toxic as all hell and selfish in that she prioritizes her cat girlfriend above everyone else, including her little sister she supposedly raised. Character assassination is the least of what was done to her.",
    "Blake and Weiss could have been amazing, just not in RT's hands. They don't have the talent required for that level of writing.",
    "This, essentially. The other three are still stuck in their delusions. Ren thinks he's a badass master swordsman when barely knows how to swing his sword. Itsuki thinks he's a hero of justice when he's really just a narcissistic twit that can't take being outshined. Motoyasu thinks he's a harem protagonist and champion to all women when he's a gullible horndog that makes every decision with his dick. And all of them have it in their heads that they're destined for glory and victory because they're surrounded by yes-men that do nothing but feed their egos. They get better later, but they all have a lot of growing up to do, yet.",
    "They're lovers because RT is more concerned with appeasing shippers than writing a story that makes sense.",
    "I actually agree with this super hard. I love 8, but I can't stand 7. And I'm not gonna pretend like 8 is everyone, because it's not. It's a game that appeals to me personally. I would like the time I spent on 7 back.",
    "Big fish in a small pond. So many of the heavy hitters among Yoma were killed during the northern war, they've had it comparatively easy. Then they had to fight one of the strongest Abyssals created from the youngest person to ever take the number 1 spot. They learned real fast how wide that gap is.",
    "It's non-existent. The initial fight actually did a decent job setting up a rivalry. Yang, a fist-fighter and team RWBY's front liner got completely and utterly trounced by Neo's superior skill. That would give Yang a reason to want a round two. What's more, Neo is the polar opposite of Yang. Yang is loud and goofy, Neo is quiet and dignified. Yang's semblance enhances her strength, Neo's creates illusions and misdirection. Yang is (at this point) a good person that tries to help people, Neo is a sadist that delights in killing people. Neo is the worst kind of opponent for Yang because she can beat her in a straight fight with little effort, and if she chooses to use her semblance, it only makes things harder for Yang. Unfortunately, nothing ever comes of this. Yang barely even acknowledges Neo despite being completely humiliated by her. Neo's desire to kill Ruby over Torchwick should give them a reason to clash, but instead Neo has carry Cinder's useless ass everywhere and Yang's only concern by the time they meet again is Blake. Blake is literally the only thing Yang gives a damn about, so any apparent rivalry is always going to fall by the wayside. Like much of a RWBY, it's a good idea with botched execution.",
