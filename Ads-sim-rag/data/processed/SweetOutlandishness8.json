    "I don\u2019t get why Jillian is so liked. She enabled the two most toxic chefs for the entire season until it came back to bite her in the ass. She was also extremely judgemental about how other chefs looked despite having painted eyebrows. For me, Gail was by far the most likable chef.",

    "Luffy is related to Roger",
    "It\u2019s not like he made zero mistakes that night. He forgot the menu and cooked white fish in the same pan as an oily fish. These are probably more egregious mistakes than a lamb that\u2019s taking a bit longer to cook.",
    "We Are!",
    "Just to be clear: Zoro must specifically pick an outsider, minion and townsfolk on the same night in order for them to be drunk.",
    "-1/10",
    "You learn nothing tonight, but you learn info on that player tomorrow if you don\u2019t nominate and an execution goes through. If you do, you learn info on the new nominee so long as they are not executed. The trick to playing this role is to nominate somewhat frequently in a game where the majority of players are scared to nominate.",

    "Monet\u2026",
    "Plague Doctor, especially with those minions.",
    "Hey guys thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it so much that I made another script. This time Kaido kills you in secret, but outsiders are allowed to nominate minions\u2026among other changes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fy19sr4jqeze1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fce76ba8990e279bd44d0f7073dc6c4b685e60b",

    "If they do that, evil loses immediately.",
    "Underrated stupid moment: Brian (S10) telling Gordon that his terribly cooked fish tastes like fish.",
    "Love the dual fabled, just be careful with some of these characters. Vaquero + Wendigo is almost a guaranteed win for evil. Prospector\u2019s ability will almost never proc, since it requires them to be alive until Night five on a script with multiple kills and Elder would make for a terrible demon bluff since it\u2019s ability procs through an execution.",
    "What does baron do if my other outsider is a Godfather?",
    "Yep, outsiders and ongoing townsfolk should be careful when nominating on this script. Good reason to not immediately kill spent townsfolk.",
    "Yes to all four points.",
    "Zoro doesn\u2019t fight with two swords, also Zoro gets lost easily. These new abilities don\u2019t make sense for Zoro. I can make it a opg ability if it\u2019s too powerful.",
    "Doflamingo, no diff.",
    "The game being over, when the outsider dies in final three. A minion can also bluff it's an Akainu day to stall the town.",
    "That is how it\u2019s supposed to work, that\u2019s why I added \u201cregardless if you\u2019re alive or dead\u201d. I think I\u2019ll change it to \u201cGood wins if the first good player who voted for you dies. Not if you die.\u201d",
    "Frank S13 after the dog show service.",
    "Similar to custom script building, you\u2019re combining characters that follow a similar mechanic, whether it be madness, multiple deaths or a homebrew mechanic. The only difference between homebrew and custom is you get to create the characters from scratch.",
    "Probably falls on the sword to keep Johnny around in episode 5.",
    "So kill the Demon in final four. You know who it isn\u2019t.",
    "You only execute the Golem if Fang Gu , Yaggababble or Boffin is on the script.",
    "Plague Doctor works well with those minions",
    "4: The first has MHA so I\u2019m perfectly fine throwing that in the fire. The second has Fairy Tale, so again in the first you go. Third has a ton of bangers and would probably be my #2 and the fifth one has two anime that already had adaptations in the 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s that are arguably better.",
    "Season 11",
    "Gossip kills should be weak/spent townsfolk and outsiders. You can also self kill the gossip if you think it will balance the game. Killing evil players should only happen if the good team is losing badly.",
    "Weird one, best challenge record ever but there were a lot of bad services. I\u2019ll say B-Tier. Brandon and Whit had train wreck services but everyone else was pretty solid.",
    "Hell\u2019s Kitchen: Switchcraft. The teams change every episode.",
    "Widow is great with Marionette, because minions can bluff widow in 10-12 player games. You can also give the Marionette a fake Widow ping.",
    "The movie is called Sinbad. It\u2019s from the early 2000\u2019s and was the last 2-D animated movie Dreamworks ever released.",

    "The Legend of Korra",
    "I always felt like Witch was a weak minion. It removes demon candidates and makes it easier to build worlds.",
    "Killing the Alchemist Fearmonger in a legion game leaving two sus good players alive. Evil won the next day.",
    "Nothing happened.",
    "Alchemist Mez is not a townsfolk, I think it\u2019s best to swap for a LoT. Also, Huntsman kinda sucks. I know Patters rules makes the character more interesting, but in general I think it\u2019s one of the worst townsfolk in the game.",
    "Thorfinn",
    "S12 Scott, since he was always bouncing around helping out struggling stations.",
    "Probably Puss, since I don\u2019t remember anyone else.",
    "\u201cI want to live!\u201d",
    "In order to make it more compatible with No Dashii and Leech, may I suggest \u201cEach night* learn if you were poisoned or drunk last night.\u201d",
    "No seriously, The entire plot of FMA is just the Alabasta Arc. Crocodile and Father literally have the same plan: Manufacture a war by playing both sides, destroy the entire city in order to become super powerful and take over the entire world. Even the Homunculi and Baroque Works have similar powers and personalities.",
    "You like one piece and FMA? Even though FMA blatantly plagiarized the Alabasta Arc.",
    "Also, all started out on the red team.",
    "Bad Charity Night?",

    "Six\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nteen\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNah, jk it\u2019s season 6",
    "The Pianist :)",
    "I\u2019d wait a couple more seasons TBH, There\u2019s not enough men from 19-23 to have an all-star blue team. And most of the others have already done it twice, are too old or surprise quit in the final 4.",
    "Why was the Revolutionary Army not at Marineford? It just feel like a missed opportunity.",
    "Jackie had one good dish in her entire run: It was a poached lobster with corn sauce :/",
    "Kinda wished Boa joined the crew. She would\u2019ve had a lot of funny interactions with Nami, Robin and Sanji.",
    "Vinland Saga> Attack on Titan> Cyberpunk> FullMetal Alabasta",
    "\u201cOnly I get to toss my salad\u201d",
    "I\u2019ll become King of the Pirates!",
    "If Elise isn\u2019t F-Tier, than the tier shouldn\u2019t exist.",
    "And yet they still dominated the red team",
    "Foxy",
    "Every time a player dies, take a shot.",
    "Joy (S12). Going from a guaranteed finalist to the 5th boot is a record only matched by Brandon (S23).",
    "Washerwoman or Librarian sees Imp/Spy as only Outsider/Townsfolk bluff. I feel like no one ever solves that world when I do it. TB is lowkey the hardest of the base 3 to solve despite everyone thinking it\u2019s \u201cbeginner friendly\u201d. BMR you just follow the kills and see if it matches with the town\u2019s abilities. SnV has a ton of broken info that becomes even easier if you figure out which demon is in play. TB\u2019s minions are quiet and they can cause a ton of misinformation if the ST is clever.",
    "Goku",
    "Fate/Zero",

    "Nah, that honor goes to thriller bark.",
    "Fang Gu adds an outsider, so 75% chance it\u2019s a heretic game with base 2 os. I\u2019ll just kill my minion(s) and day 3-4 rerack if I draw the token.",
    "North vs South. Especially since you have Michelle and James as Sous chefs.",
    "S9 Wil and S21 Alex come to mind.",
    "Congrats Kyle! Which chef was the worst roommate?",
    "Yes, Kyle had a way better finals performance than Hannah.",
    "Each night, choose two players: if they are both evil they both turn good. N1: chooses demon and spy, nothing happens.",
    "Pat and Aaron (and Wendy/Shaina/Ryan). Koop was way too much of a hot head and Devin was almost as whiny as Paulie. Seriously, dude thought he was hot shit after fucking up a kid\u2019s grilled cheese.",
    "LoT does not work with these minions.",
    "When my demon starpassed to me in final 4, even though I was a way bigger demon candidate and there was no mechanical info pointing to them (I had a late Empath 1 in final 4).",
    "Goomba at 100/20",
    "Crocodile from One Piece",
    "Raiden (MGS), We already have Snake, so why not?",
    "Spy can\u2019t poison, can\u2019t manipulate outsiders and can\u2019t save the Demon of it\u2019s executed. If all the powerful characters are getting killed in the night, it becomes obvious it\u2019s a spy game.",
    "Also, I seriously doubt All Might is more powerful than Luffy.",
    "Goku, Naruto, Luffy and Light",
    "Shanks using Haki on a Sea King in Romance Down.",
    "Georgia\u2019s looking awfully close that black hole.",
    "Gol D. Roger",
    "Septa lines are way scarier than MTA",
    "Also, magician does nothing.",
    "You need an extra outsider for a 6 player game with baron. May I suggest mutant.",
    "Gizzy or Giovanni. Anthony\u2019s dish could\u2019ve been lethal, so his elimination was fair. Gizzy and Gio were eliminated to keep around drama queens.",
    "A Double-Claiming Baron who gets seen by an Undertaker is awful for the evil team.",
    "FullMetal Alchemist is great, FullMetal Alabasta is pretty good too if not a bit overrated.",
    "I get it, Maybe Seattle can be Chaotic Good?",
    "Never (and I mean NEVER) have a sober Investigator, Empath and Fortune Teller in the same game. At least one of those must be drunk, misregister or be a demon bluff. Adding a sober chef is insult to injury.",
    "New York has the Naked Cowboy. Philly chucked snowballs and batteries at Santa Claus.",
    "Amazon Lily Luffy. That shirt is worth two family jewels!!",
    "Lawful Good: SLC\n\nNeutral Good: Minneapolis\n\nChaotic Good: New Orleans\n\nLawful Neutral: St. Louis\n\nTrue Neutral: Milwaukee\n\nChaotic Neutral: NYC\n\nLawful Evil: DC\n\nNeutral Evil: Dallas\n\nChaotic Evil: Philly",

    "Usopp?",
    "The Verminator",
    "This character can\u2019t move, poison, manipulate outsider count or kill multiple times per night. It\u2019s very weak.",
    "Megamind",
    "Ties go to the good team",
    "I like it, just don\u2019t make it an elimination challenge.",
    "*Tighten",
    "Dog what do you want? A soppy backstory about how Kaido murdered his entire family and somehow let Zoro slip to the East Blue? His goal is to become the world\u2019s strongest swordsman and after Wano, he became a lot closer to becoming the world\u2019s strongest swordsman.",
    "I completely disagree that Zoro \u201cgot nothing\u201d in Wano. He mastered conqueror\u2019s Hali that arc and had his best fights of the series.",
    "Matthew, could you be more forgettable?",
    "Poisoning the damsel in final four (Lil\u2019 Monsta game)",
    "Rocky from Chicken Run",
    "Alternatively, do one black jacket challenge as a reward challenge like in season 12 and then have a black jacket dinner service with everyone in one kitchen w/ the winner eating at the chefs table.",
    "Full Metal Alabasta",
    "Thanks for the feedback, I made some changes\n\n1. Thousand Sunny learns their info with four or less alive instead of five\n2. Brook's ability is completely different. Now they learn a word each day and learn how many said it in town square that night.\n3. Usopp no longer has OS modification. It's two characters that know each other are good regardless if they are poisoned.\n4. Moria's ability is now worded \"If the demon dies within the first two days, they keep their ability and the game continues until you die.\" TBH, Moria is probably just a SW in the OP world with their Shadow Fruit, but I tried to change it slightly in order to make their ability unique.",
    "Unless Zoro selects a minion, an outsider and a townsfolk you wouldn't show them \"demon\"",
    "4, need that aisle seat to stretch my legs and I\u2019d prefer not to sit next to a psychopath.",
    "How the fuck in Ann Marie still here?",
    "Bullies contestants, starts fights for no reason, cries during punishments, doesn\u2019t participate in said punishments, rude to chef and guest judges.\n\nAlso, she\u2019s not that good at cooking. She\u2019s not bad, but I doubt she lasts more than five episodes in a modern season.",
    "I\u2019m poking fun at people who don\u2019t read the wiki and then ask questions on this server that were explained in the wiki.",
    "Damn, you guys need to go outside more! Blood on the Clocktower is a social deduction game. This is sarcasm.",
    "This sounds like a worse version of a dreamer.",
    "The game ends with 2 players. In that scenario, the good Leshy would\u2019ve already lost before they had the chance to kill themself.",
    "Die by night roles are supposed to be powerful. If the evil team doesn\u2019t want their abilities to trigger, don\u2019t kill them.",
    "Think of this scenario: The town executes the Vampire in final 6, sounds good right? Wrong! The new Vampire kills the Poltergeist and they proceed to make two good players a Basalisk and Leshy respectively.\n\nCongrats evil team!",
    "Poltergeist: When you die, choose two players and two non-demon characters they become (If not in play).\n\nDo I need to explain why giving a minion the power to make two additional demons is a bad idea \u201cdeaths are arbitrary\u201d doesn\u2019t solve the problem if only four other players are alive.",
    "I\u2019ll say normal service, simply due to it being normal. I hope they do another Chefs vs Vets.",
    "Douglas Bullet- Rebel Evil",
    "The idea here, is that you pick a good player and then they kill themselves and win (Satanist swap happens before the evil team kills in the night order). Of course if you pick an evil player, that might not happen and you\u2019ll look sus in final three.\n\nIf you are on the evil team, killing/poisoning the satanist is a must. Their ability is game-breaking but it doesn\u2019t trigger until the final 5. If it is final 5, convince the Satanist to pick an evil player. The game will still continue and you can frame them in final 3 or end the game before that with an execution & 2 night deaths.",
    "Satanist (Townsfolk): If there are 5 players or less, publicly choose a player (not yourself). They swap characters with the demon tonight.",
    "One Piece",
    "Seems redundant with Harborer and Diviner.",
    "The idea here is that you pick a good player to become the Demon and then they kill themself. Of course, if you pick an evil player that\u2019s not going to happen and you\u2019ll be in an awkward situation in final 3.",
    "Dungeon Master (Townsfolk): If there are four players alive or less, publicly choose a player (not yourself). They swap characters with the current demon tonight.",
    "Simply by allowing an evil player to pit hag twice guarantees a dual demon set up after final 6.",
    "Also, SAO. Paladin is after Shepherd. Bartender is at the end.",
    "So in a final 4 situation, can the storyteller kill the new demon and bring the poltergeist back to life, or is it an automatic game over?",
    "1. Playwright could be Vampire Picked\n\n2. Nightcrawler and Paladin\n\n3. Vampire",
    "Out of all Base 3 Scripts, BMR is the most fair. Both good and evil have to be active to push info or spread bullshit. All the info is out in the open, and it\u2019s up to the good team to interpret it in a way that makes sense.",
