    "I read from where the webtoon left off and there isn\u2019t much difference. There is very little you miss out on, like some dialogue, some small situations, descriptions, and some key insights. It would be better to read from the beginning, but personally I don\u2019t have that kind of time to waste",
    "Insane spelling of his name",
    "It doesn\u2019t take much away from the story, but some of the titles, such as grades of constellations, are inconsistent and confusing (especially when compared to the webtoon). I recommend reading the full webtoon and then moving on the to novel because then if there\u2019s any inconsistencies, you have the context from the official translations in the webtoon to fill in the gaps. Other than that, there\u2019s no problem with continuing to read the novel",
    "Wonder Egg Priority",
    "There definitely are grammar and sentence structure errors, but it\u2019s the same anywhere you read it. It seems like whoever translated the entirety of ORV (not the creator of that site, because other sources like WebNovel look exactly the same), that translator didn\u2019t get it proofread or edited. That\u2019s just what I think",
    "Shinra maybe",
