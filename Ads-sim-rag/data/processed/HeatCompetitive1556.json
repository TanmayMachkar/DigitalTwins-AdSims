    "Gilgamesh easily. Even when he is losing it\u2019s because he took it easy on the \u201cMongrel\u201d and he absolutely refuses to use his full power until the last second even if it would be a for sure win if he opened up with his finisher 99.9% of the time.",
    "If the live action movies were \u201cCheap\u201d that would be one thing but most are well over $300 million with the absurd amount of CGI they shove in. They all look and feel soulless compared to their classics.",
    "This is just a fight between DrManhattan and Spectre. Everyone else is fodder vs them. Honestly with the way Dr Manhattan is portrayed this battle goes one of two ways. Either he can disintegrate Spectre\u2019s molecules since Spectre isn\u2019t completely immortal in which case Dr Manhattan wins. If he can\u2019t just vaporize Spectre then it\u2019s a battle without end since it\u2019s impossible to kill Dr Manhattan unless you destroy every universe simultaneously considering he exists in all realities and can recreate himself even when he has no atomic particles left. \n\nDr Manhattan is the ultimate \u201cyou can\u2019t do anything to me\u201d character because his body is essentially an avatar for his consciousness which exists beyond space time and whatever universe you are currently interacting with him in. Coupling this with the fact he can recreate his body on a whim from nothing you can\u2019t kill him. Most likely he and Spectre would just debate the meaning of existence and morality.\n\nAlso alien X doesn\u2019t have shit on Dr Manhattan. He would just erase the omnitrix from existence despite its fail-safes and his power is a direct counter to whatever alien the omnitrix can use. Alien X has weaknesses and isn\u2019t immortal or existing beyond reality itself.",
    "Can anything in the Narutoverse counter Gojo\u2019s infinity? Considering genjutsu is confirmed to not work on those lacking a chakra network I don\u2019t see how anyone in Naruto could stop Gojo. Let me know if I\u2019m wrong on this but I just see Gojo turning the brain of any ninja he faces into mush.",
    "Considering OFA increases everything about the user and gives them the other quirks Kirashima or TetsuTesu might have been interesting choices. A hardening and steel skin quirk are pretty basic but then you give the insane power of OFA and the accompanying quirks and the power up of their natural quirk would be kinda crazy. Just a pure tank mode destroyer that would really only be countered by Shiggy\u2019s Decay.\n\nI just imagine Kirishima using Fajin and absolutely blasting through whatever with his body acting like a near indestructible high speed battering ram.",
    "21 years old and looks like a toddler who was dropped way too many times",
    "In the comics that\u2019s the entire point of the gauntlet itself is that it handles the power and controls the stones for the user. The gauntlet even without the stones is an extremely potent creation enhancing the users strength speed and durability",
    "![gif](giphy|b4StGNlewQ5mU|downsized)\n\nWhat can top this insanity?",
    "When I see someone try to defend an organization, either fiction or real, that is KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE AND SPREADING TERROR saying it is not a terrorist organization I think we need to give them a one way ticket to Palestine.",
    "We see this post every day it seems",
    "Silver age is a for sure Superman he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat and that\u2019s only because Silver age Superman is a literal meme to extents that make Saitama\u2019s power scaling potential look like a legless cancer baby.",
    "Dude fr. Like they aren\u2019t taking on major planet busters from the DBZ universe but if Shiggy touches you it\u2019s game over unless it\u2019s some crazy god level being. It\u2019s why Pain from Naruto scales so hard while most of the Naruto verse gets stomped. Any enemy who can get an insta kill by touch and has some form of \u201cget in close blitz\u201d or a healing gimmick is busted by most power scaling lists.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s nice when people actually take into account busted abilities instead of the \u201coh Yamcha solos the verse\u201d wank",
    "No atoms means no regen and if worst comes to pass Deku is casually tossing him into space since his punches can change the weather globally. Death would be a mercy over being stuck in a constant state of cellular destruction and pain floating in space.",
    "Deku is just punting Tanjiro into space so either Tanjiro is suffering a constant state of cellular death in space forever unless he goes into a star or black hole or at the absolute best case for him he burns to nothing in atmospheric reentry and dies that way.",
    "Immortality means nothing if a dude can drop kick you into space. Izuku at his best is sending shockwaves with a punch that went from Japan across the ocean and into America. Worst case for  Tanjiro he is stuck in a constant death state in space and best case is he burns up to nothing reentering the atmosphere.",
    "It\u2019s kinda the entire gimmick of his power it grows stronger every time it gets a new user and it finally goes critical max with him which is why he had such a hard time controlling it. The other users of One for All straight up tell him he is the first who has access to its full power and bro is making hits that send shockwaves from Japan to America in the final battle. If All Might prime had been able to pull that off there would be absolutely no way in hell the world wouldn\u2019t have known about his battle with All for One since that is some global scale damage and not just a tremor.\n\nAll that said ya gojo is melting his brain",
    "Why the hell would Deku be $2 when by the later point in the manga he is WAY past the height of All Might\u2019s powers even when All Might was in his prime?",
    "I give Shera a pass because that show was intentionally made to be as gay as humanly possible and Shera was not nearly as well known as Heman or Conan. It was literally catering to a niche audience that wanted that kinda thing and it didn\u2019t try to hide what it was or bait and switch the audience and did what it set out to do by being a gayer than gay could gay show. \n\nTHAT BEING SAID. Netflix Heman should have been a show for the guys with our hero crushing bad guys and sexy woman fighting in skimpy outfits. You know, like Heman has always been.",
    "Ishizu is pure egyptian which while in Africa is not black and Yoruichi is usually seen as southeast asian or from India. But for dark skinned characters they are good choices.",
    "July giveth once more",
    "Since this isn\u2019t comic Noir then Luke Cage is smashing the others. This is also movie Batman not comic or animated Batman so he isn\u2019t mega prepping his way to victory.",
    "Steve would very much have tried to talk everyone down but would not have for a second let the Flag Smashers think they were in the right or even remotely allowed that idea to be humored. They were terrorists and killed innocent people, Steve doesn\u2019t let that shit go unless they weren\u2019t in control of their actions which they VERY much were. It\u2019s a different situation than when Bucky was brainwashed as the Winter Solider making his actions be on his controller. Even Tony admits that yet at the end of the day you never forgive anyone involved in killing your parents even if innocent which was great writing in Civil War. \n\nWhat Steve would not have done is give the \u201cyou need to do better senator\u201d speech in the way Sam did. He would have called out that the negligence caused suffering that created a terrorist movement and better acknowledged the actual facts of the matter since he is a no nonsense solider. He would have felt sympathy for them but still put them down without hesitation because at the end of the day they killed A LOT of innocent people.",
    "This difference here is Batman almost never throws down in fist fights with the powerhouse beings in the DC Universe. When he does he has plot armor up to the eyeballs with some bullshit device or it\u2019s some meme team making the material that knows nothing of power scaling like when he kicked Darkseid and made him stumble in the animated series. Most of his villains he battles are more grounded street level and when it\u2019s the high end fights he functions as the JL\u2019s tactical leader and not a front line fighter like Superman and Wonder Woman. Sam getting slapped around by Red Hulk would be like Batman taking a punch from Solomon Grundy in his stronger revivals or Doomsday before his scaling went wild and then Batman survives which is just not happening. If Sam had taken the super solider enhancement that\u2019s a different story but they chose not to do that. My biggest issue is that bro\u2019s head is completely exposed so that is getting splattered or his brain is turning to mush since vibranium isn\u2019t taking that impact damage. Even if he just hits the ground or a wall he is at best brain damaged from the force even if his head doesn\u2019t make impact since, as stated, vibranium is not taking the shock from impact. GIVE THE MAN A HELMET and then we can have a rational discussion on how he tanks Red Hulk punches. If a car crash can potentially cause brain bleeding or brain damage to the unprotected skull of a regular person then flying into a wall or street from the impact speed of a Red Hulk punch sending you flying is doing that and more.\n\nI despise the \u201cvibranium armor for everyone\u201d crap because it\u2019s a total cop out in the MCU now when it was unique to Cap\u2019s shield and Black Panther\u2019s armor before. Instead of having to actually show how to use tactics and skill in a fight why bother when \u201coh it\u2019s fine I have vibranium armor and can\u2019t lose\u201d. It\u2019s gotten to be ridiculous because we have regular dudes taking hits from characters that have been some of the heaviest hitters. Even Black Panther used stealth for takedowns and his armor was way more advanced with its kinetic absorption.\n\nBatman uses hit and run, smoke bombs, and long range gadgets along with traps to gain his victories. During Batman vs Superman in the fight Superman blatantly holds back to extreme degrees both in the comics and on screen because he knows if he punched Batman for real then even with Batman\u2019s strongest plot armor that boy is gonna be a blood stain. They could have easily shown Sam using all his skills and combat knowledge to avoid Red Hulk and use his guns, flight, taunts, and gear to avoid a single hit but nope, gotta show how the regular human without any enhancements other than gear tanks hits from Red Hulk who has laid the beat down on the Silver Surfer and other Marvel powerhouses. Even if this Red Hulk is nerfed he is still a Hulk.",
    "Cringe with a side of derp.",
    "I\u2019ll take Dr Strange and Hulk. Strange can go to another dimension with me and we wait while Hulk infinite rage builds until he can kill everyone else.",
    "JJ Jameson easy no questions asked. Dude is a douche but under no situation am I getting sent into a shootout or murdered for screwing up. Also Jameson actually does stick his neck out for his workers a lot both in film and comics. He doesn\u2019t give up his sources or those who work for him unless it\u2019s other innocent people on the line. The man is based on a boss from a different time, he demands respect and hard work but protects those under him because he knows the value of sources and loyalty from staff.",
    "Dude I had a guy in another post argue teen goku is FTL and a planet buster\u2026 the glazing is insane. At the start of DBZ he got shit kicked by Raditz who wasn\u2019t a planet buster and that was vs adult Goku. I don\u2019t understand why people think Goku is killing gods and destroying galaxies at any given point. It\u2019s as if they never even watched the show or read a single manga page.",
    "Roshi has to literally tap into his life force for his maxed out Kamehameha and it\u2019s a feat that isn\u2019t replicated by many characters in the dragon ball franchise. It\u2019s like a Roshi special and is unique to him during the younger years when Goku is a kid and teen. As I put above Raditz is not a planet buster and Goku is significantly weaker than him during g their battle at the start of DBZ as an adult so teen Goku is most likely not even moon buster unless he goes absolutely nuts and masters Kamehameha in great ape form. \n\nAlso by no means is Goku FTL pre Sayian Saga. Bro is still having to use the nimbus for max travel speed at that point and I\u2019d argue he doesn\u2019t reach FTL until late game finale on Namek\u2026 as an adult. Even when he rushes to fight Vegeta during the Sayian saga it takes him \u201ctime\u201d to get there after his arrival back on on Earth and if he was FTL he would be there in an instant and again, that\u2019s adult Goku not teen Goku. You are hilariously overscaling his teen speed. It doesn\u2019t matter if he could crush any Naruto verse character\u2019s skull like a grape even as a teen with his far superior physical power because there is no way he is out pacing them in speed or cheat abilities. I\u2019ll agree that Genjutsu wouldnt work because he has no chakra network but bro isn\u2019t beating Naruto and Sasuke in their prime when he is a teen.",
    "Teen Goku is Dragon ball late game Goku not DBZ Goku since Goku was 23 after the time jump when DBZ started. Even during his fight with Raditz Goku wasn\u2019t a planet buster yet especially considering Raditz who was at that point was far stronger was not a planet buster. There is also a MASSIVE power scaling difference between teen Goku at the End of Dragon Ball vs Goku at even the start of DBZ. \n\nDuring this fight just due to Naruto and Sasuke being shown as Ninja War and as adults they are going to absolutely shit kick teen Goku even if he is outrageously stronger physically. They win by pure cheat skills and speed during this point. Genjutsu, Susanoo, and Amaterasu are just instant win conditions in this matchup. Now if they were fighting Goku at any point after his training with King Kai then he annihilates them low to no diff.",
    "The genjutsu doesn\u2019t even matter, if it\u2019s \u201cteen\u201d Goku he straight up can\u2019t deal with even half the crazy shit Naruto and Sasuke can pull off during the ninja war and he DEFINITELY isn\u2019t handling them when they are adults. Goku power scales drastically from even his prime of Dragon Ball to his basic stats of DBZ. Teen Goku was end of Dragon Ball since he is 23 at the start of DBZ.",
    "If its current MCU Loki he can solo the other 5. If it is not current Loki then Thor can solo. There is a MASSIVE difference in the power levels of story lord Loki and Thor versus everyone else on this list.",
    "A lover and tactical data analyst does not a good warrior make.",
    "In the Netflix Daredevil he was the absolute greatest portrayal of Kingpin Wilson Fisk from the comics that we will ever see on live screen. Disney making his character a punchline in their trash CW level Marvel shows is an insult to the man. I feel like Disney deliberately loves to shit on him and Charlie Cox\u2019s Daredevil with bad humor takes and losing every fight to D list characters because the Netflix season one of Daredevil is an absolute peak super hero tv show and they despite the high bar it set.",
    "Provided they don\u2019t run into Beru then Endeavor, Jouske, Naofumi, Toji, and Frieren are all surviving with Frieren potentially killing Beru in the right circumstances.\n\nEndeavor can fly at high speeds and his fire most likely has him at low tier S rank but suffers from over heating and can\u2019t do some of the insane shit Choi Jong-Il can in Solo Leveling like the fire net shield over the volcano. As arguably the strongest Jojo, Jouske has insane power and his ability to go beyond is keeping him alive. Current level Naofumi is a serious tank and has some creative BS abilities he can pull out so he is most assuredly making it out alive since he can hold out while the fire power clears. Toji is a serious threat in Jujutsu Kaisen and I\u2019d say he is probably A rank with his skill set and ability to negate powers which if it works on jujutsu curses will probably work on monsters mana. Frieren solo clears, with her range of spells, quick mind, and her ability for destruction she is most assuredly at the low end of national rank of hunters. If anyone on this list even has a prayer against Beru it\u2019s her and she would have an actual good chance of beating him if he didn\u2019t straight up speed blitz burst her head off since she can manipulate time.\n\nNezuko is durable but the feats in demon slayer which can injure her means she is dead meat to even basic ants on the island. Mikasa can cut titan flesh but that\u2019s basically just a big human and she isn\u2019t doing shit all for damage vs literally anything on the island even with her peak genetics she is just an extremely capable human with enhanced speed and strength so she is getting killed. Goblin Slayer is bad ass but he is ultimately just an extremely pissed off guy and he isn\u2019t making despite his gear and ability to utilize magic scrolls if shit gets bad.",
