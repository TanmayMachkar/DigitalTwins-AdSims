    "This might be dumb but why black castanor is called black castanor when it is not sited in castanor and the black desmene is the one in castanor?",

    "I mean in terms of scaling, Doom will scale the most but if these 4 were in a 1 year prep time to kill one another, kira no diffs all of them, in a year you have more than enough time to find everyone's name here and after all they're all humans, actually the list would reverse, if normally it would go like:\n\nDoom\nBatman \nLelouch\nKira\n\nIn terms of difficult to kill for kira is:\n\nLelouch \nBatman\nDoom\n\nThe 2 firsts being public figures are the easiest by far and lelouch being the only one with a fake name here.",

If eu4 was a board game I could give it a pass since the distribution and printing of the cards and new rules may justify it, with what's almost a single JSON file it has no redemption to me, I didn't buy eu4 until the last sales of December where I could buy the whole package for 40$."
