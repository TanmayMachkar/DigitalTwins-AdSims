    "The thing is Barou and Rin. In the U-20 sure Barou scored but he was pushing it and almost made Isagi lose the ball right after he score if it wasn't for Bachira. If he is on the field with people that won't fully submit to him then things will go awry. I think even worse than Barou is Rin ACTIVELY avoiding to score just so that he can score in a cooler way.",
    "Makima.",
    "I just hate Luffy's dubbed voice so I avoid the dub as much as possible.",

    "OHHHH I feel less smart now",
    "Wait I havent seen this person in the manwha or anime who is it? Am I just forgetting a random side character or is she important.",
    "You do realize that unlike the real world Pirates or Marines can take over your island and force you into the worst living conditions possible right? You can also just get randomly kidnapped or sold if your king is evil enough, 100% gotta hope you aren't born in the grandline,  and also pts Zoro was incredibly strong for just training everyday and I would assume you might have some freetime compared to now since technology is less advanced and there isnt much to do in comparison.",
    "Sub because new anime release faster in sub. Other than that then it just depends on which I like faster. I like One Piece in sub because I genuinely hate Luffy's voice in dub and for a while the dub was Insanely behind the sub, but for Gurren Lagann (my favorite anime) I watched it in dub because that was the default setting on Netflix.",
    "Share the world. (Going based off the song and the opening visuals)",
    "Wait how are we even supposed to tell you our favorite thing without spoilers even IF there were seasons in one piece?",
    "He didn't unlock his haki at the time",
    "I don't see a divine protection for giant mech so my goat Simon got this",
    "Not only was his DF op but he is actually one of the smartest characters in One Piece. He built the entire Arc Maxim alone, used his fruit to enhance his haki using electromagnetic waves (No character has used their fruit to enhance their haki in the series), used his fruit to RESTART HIS OWN HEART, figured out Luffy's weakness, he also figured out that he can travel through physical matter as long as its conductive enough, and has shown some incredible intelligence feats.",
    "If you see a great white shark and you are in the water with it would that experience make you less scared of seeing a wolf? You are going to be scared in both situations because no matter what your opponent is still stronger than you.",
    "Are we gonna act like the straw hats didnt steal all of the skypeian's wallets? THEY ALL ARE DIRTY CRIMINALS!!",
    "To be fair the stuff in the one piece world is super terrifying to a normal human",
    "You lucky son of a gun",
    "Why is Kiyora the guy with 1 assist in the ENTIRE NEL on the same tier as raichi locking people up on defense? He was also guarding Snuffy so that's gotta be an amazing feat right?",
    "I kinda think that's the point where besides that moment with Andre, Igris and, someone else Sjw can't rely on anyone and NEEDS to do all this by himself. It adds a certain layer of stress knowing that if he messed up then everything is over. I would like to also point out that I'd Mumen Rider was in the SL universe and a Dungeon break happens then he is 100% dieing the first time he attempts to fight back. SL is more realistic which means it has way more deaths which put the characters at a much larger risk. I also think it's due to how the hunters are made which doesn't allow them to get stronger that really makes sjw put himself out there. He NEEDS to get stronger, he NEEDS to stay consistent, he NEEDS to keep putting himself in these situations because he is the only person that can make humans life's better. I see it as more of a bonus to sjw's character than I do a negative to the overall story.",
    "Bro was only able to land the uppercut because of evil and you can call that plot Armour as much as you want. Also his punch did knock Baran's head off his body but Baran's blast that he was chracging up exploded causing the rain to stop so idk why you acting like that's one of sjw's feats.",
    "Me: May I see your panties Imu:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5v8af3yfjawe1.jpeg?width=637&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e75723c0e4f077481fdd20423aaadbf4cb6b5133",
    "So the Baran fight wasn't enough struggle?",
    "I would still give the edge to dragon for being the most dangerous man. He has info about Imu which is a MAJOR detriment to the WG, messed with the CD's whole food supply, and has been causing rebellions across the world and he hasn't even made his move yet whatever it is. We don't know how strong he is but due to the amount of damage that he has done PLUS the damage he will do in the future is way more then Luffy. In comparison luffy defeated some warlords, Broke into Government facilities, a few territories, and he has vegapunk and Robin. On his run he has shown to not really do much. He doesn't randomly attack islands, and realistically he has harmed pirates more than he has the WG so I dont think they would find him much of a threat to them compared to Dragon that has been messing with them for years and on a MUCH larger scale than luffy.",
    "My favorite part of One Piece powerscaling is when a character shows ANY haki feat and people start analyzing it to see what kind of haki they are using.",
    "I feel like we would've gotten some sort of lore drop in marineford about his race if he was a buccaner. Kuma and bonny were created before marineford so I think Oda would've included at least some sort of hint during WB's final moments.",
    "Esdeath\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4c40vyy6gwte1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef704668e4fe42fe6755b2ce8f133a1086d37ec1",

    "Wait hold on. Are we talking manga bumsagi or anime only cause bro in the manga actually is a menace.",
    "No need to apologize so much since I'm actually glad I got to see these. I've watched the majority of the anime (up to onigashima raid) before switching to the manga so I haven't gotten the chance to see the large amount of color spreads from the manga. I can kinda see it now tho, there is wayyyy more stuff in the color pages which makes sense since Oda doesmt have even space in the actual story. I also just realized how little interactions he has with Nami, Zoro, and sanji. I do wish that we had more crew development with the last 3 straw hats since sometimes they just feel like they are just there.",
    "This is one thing I never understood. Besides the ball destruction I dont think these two have that much compatability. I guess Robin rejecting Franky's ideas like the combination in thriller bark could be a nice little thing in the relationship but I still don't see it.",
    "https://preview.redd.it/a1ydhqxgmite1.jpeg?width=626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b7f0a137bb598f1375b015f27ffc5b7b8a0f163\n\nThe BROLY boost?!!??!?!?!?!?!",

    "To be fair, watching a man's face get blown off is way more traumatizing than just some big ole bitties.",
    "You misspelled Shanks",
    "This is an anime subrwddut buddy so no LN feats. Also don't forget about igris since he I hear the SL LN gets up there. (Too lazy to read LNs myself)",
    "Dang you really hate red team for putting a guy that breaths good up against God's in comparison. I genuinely don't think anyone can break out of merlin's perfect cube so they just cooked.",
    "Bro changed his mind that quick?",
    "Oh dang I should've suggested earlier episodes but I hope you enjoy the long ride that is One Piece.",
    "I actually think 1015. But if you dont want to show the absolute BEST part then I would say the finale of the enies lobby Lucci fight. Sorry for not giving the exact number but I haven't watched the actual episode in YEARS.",
    "Falls for it everytime",
