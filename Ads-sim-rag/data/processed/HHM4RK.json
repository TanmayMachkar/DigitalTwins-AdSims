    "Not a chance. Very can\u2019t get past logia bullshit but let\u2019s just say he can.\n\nHe still loses.",
    "It\u2019s Minato, Boruto and then Naruto.\n\nSpoilers ahead!!! \n\n\n\n\nMinato created the Rasengan in 3 years, it was in his teens. Not sure when exactly but he had in his light novel and I believe he was in his late teens then.\n\nHe was around early twenties when he died. I believe  he was like 21 or something like that. But anyway he created the jutsu that is heralded as the pinnacle of shape transformation jutsu when he was in teens.\n\nHe improved/perfected the Flying Raijin. And he was a seal master on par with the Uzumaki\u2019s. \n\nBoruto did only take about three days to add a nature release to the Rasengan. He wasn\u2019t the first to do it sick Naruto has done it. He did do it faster than Naruto though, much faster.\n\nBoruto also recreated the Flying Raijin. It\u2019s different to Minato\u2019s and weaker I believe but he did re create it.\n\nEdit: I did forget about Rasengan Uzuhiko which is a very cool variation of the Rasengan.\n\nBut most of Boruto\u2019s power comes from his Karma Seal.\n\nNaruto\u2019s comes from Kurama and his massive chakra reserves.\n\nMinato is just a badass. He didn\u2019t come from any big clan or have any special kekkei genkai or power.\n\nHe is just pure talent.\n\nThat is why I say the list is Minato - Boruto - Naruto.",
    "Yeah my bad bro.\n\nEven without that aspect of Wood Release Hashi would likely still win.",
    "Yep I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know why I thought it was only Tailed Beast Chakra.\n\nSo with that rule then Hashi could suppress Kuzan\u2019s Haki since \u201cHaki = Chakra\u201d.",
    "People using the Pubk Hazzard fight as scaling for Kuzan is mental. We didn\u2019t see anything about the fight. We just got statements. Just because they fight for 10 days doesn\u2019t mean they were going all out for every single hour of every single day.\n\nHashirama wins.",
    "If doesn\u2019t, it suppresses/absorbs Tailed Beast Chakra and that\u2019s it. Pretty the \u201cHaki = Chakra\u201d thinf is just so Hashi can actually get though Kuzan\u2019s Logia.",
    "Yeah he can teleport instantly. Minato can\u2019t kill Hashirama but neither can Hashirama. The only way is to get rid of all of Minato\u2019s marks and I doubt Hashi could find all of them.\n\nTwo minato\u2019s constantly teleporting around the field will be insanely hard to track either with Hashi\u2019s abilities.\n\nThree is an ez win for Minato. Two Minato\u2019s would be able to win as well but it\u2019d be much harder.",
    "I like the look of the new ban system. I love how it\u2019s more strategic. But the best part are the updates graphics for sure.\n\nI had a good pc and I would like for its power to be used by R6 lol.\n\nDoc\u2019s changes also sound pretty good for the game.",
    "I was successfully rage baited until I saw Kazuma",
    "https://preview.redd.it/kvs8bs29xj0f1.jpeg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e21e1c9658015be17c7fc83e913a0959be23eca\n\nI\u2019m done for but at least he\u2019ll look cool whilst we both die.",
    "This is why spotters are a thing",
    "Oh really damn. I thought he just had what Luffy had. \n\n\u2026and now I realise that\u2019s stupid because of what Gear 5 told us.",
    "I\u2019m not sure if Rak can get through the whole Mochi body thing.\n\nYamato and Fuji get absolutely beat. Then if Rak can\u2019t get through the Mochi body since he doesn\u2019t have Haki then Pain just uses Human Path and yoinks Katakuri\u2019s soul.",
    "Yeah with ease. He\u2019s a beloved war hero and the fourth Hokage. Konoha loves him. He knew Obito/Tobi was behind the attack, he would\u2019ve said so and everyone would\u2019ve believed him.\n\nHe likely wouldn\u2019t be very happy with Hiruzen and Danzo for sending the Uchiha to guard the border as well.\n\nMinato is just a nice dude. It\u2019s also not a stretch to suggest he was friends with Fugaku since it was confirmed Kushina and Mikoto were best friends. \n\nHe would\u2019ve easily stopped the coup if it even had a chance to happen in the first place.",
    "So the obvious choice is to gain powers that are similar to Wukongs ability.\n\nSo outright shapeshifting into multiple animals transformations would be cool.\n \nHiruzen was really goood with a Bo staff so the hilly to augment your Bo Staff with sage chakra and change its length and size would be sick.\n\nEnhanced agility and nimbleness is obvious. Potentially the ability to make a sage chakra tail if you perfect sage mode. Imperfect will just have a tail lol.\n\nWukong has even more powers that could be turned into sage mode techniques but I arent that knowledgeable about him.\n\nEdit: my dumbass forgot about his clone ability. You could make clones but they were truly perfect copies that follow your orders. So they take a lot of damage before they pop an disappear. Even more than the likes of wood clones.\n\nEdit 2: so just thought of something else for the clone ability. You could have it be a single clone but one that\u2019s a truly perfect copy. You\u2019re completely indistinguishable except for the fact that the clone has a time limit of about 30 mins.\n\nSo it has blood and can die like a normal human, except it\u2019s completely subservient. \n\nIf you want to nerf it a bit. You could have it basically be a second body for you. So you have two bodies basically, you can control them both.\n\nIt would then fit that Hiruzen didn\u2019t attain the sage mode so me you could make it insanely hard to master to the point that Emma never met anyone he believed could learn the sage mode.\n\nAlso Enma can teach, Hiruzen\u2019s Monkey King Summon.",
    "Hearts of Iron IV\n\nMount and Blade 2: Bannerlord\n\nTotal War: Warhammer 3",
    "Bro why are Goku, Vegeta, Gogeta on here. They ain\u2019t red heads lol",
    "As much as I love Hashirama and Madara, they lose here. Even if Itachi doesn\u2019t have the Totsuka Blade or the Yata Mirror the Jonin team still has Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi.\n\nNow this is a lot interesting to think about if we distracted those two abilities and say for some reason Shisui and Itachi can\u2019t use them.\n\nI believe the Jonin team has a chance. It\u2019s unfortunate that we don\u2019t really now the full extent of Fugaku, Shisui and Sakumo\u2019s power so I can\u2019t give an accurate answer.\n\nAll of them were said at some point to be strong ninja. Asuma is irrelevant in this fight, he does nothing unfortunately since I like Asuma.\n\nWe saw in the war arc an Eight Gate Guy can almost beat Juubidara so Eight Gate Guy beats Prime Madara on his own in my opinion.\n\nSo that basically just leaves the rest versus Hashirama. Unfortunately we also don\u2019t know much about prime Hashirama except that he can beat Prime Madara and The Kyuubi together.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know if Hashirama would lose or win. Let\u2019s assume that guy dies just after he kills Madara so he can\u2019t use the eight gates gassing Hashirama.\n\nHashirama has a massive advantage in this fight. Just looking at what he was capable of in his fight with Madara. The Kanon is just sick.\n\nI believe most of the Jonin would survive that attack simply because Kakashi can send them to the Kamui dimension or Minato can teleport them away.\n\nIn the end I believe it comes down to longevity. I believe with Minato teleporting around and potentially saving people from death or Obito pulling the focus on him and using Kamui to dodge attacks, they could last a good amount of time.\n\nUnfortunately I do think they\u2019d lose. I don\u2019t believe they have the attack power to put Hashirama down for good.\n\nSummary: With Koto and Tsukiyomi, the Jonin\u2019s win. Without those two technique, Hashirama and Madara win.",
    "u/profanitycounter [self]",
    "EZ Dub for Sung Jin Woo. I mean give my guy a match up that actually challenges him please!",
    "Detective Picachu is a fantastic film. It\u2019s hilarious and a fantastic live action adaptation.\n\nOne Piece is also really good.\n\nDragonball: Evolutions is a hit pile of garbage",
    "There are genuine reasons for hating her but if you get tot end of Shipp\u016bden and into Boruto then you\u2019re hating just for the sake of hating.\n\nI hated her in Part 1, she was that annoying useless girl who always got in the mc\u2019s way. But she redeemed herself in part 2.\n\nI mean one of the first instances big points we see her, she kicks the ever loving shit out of Sasori\u2019s puppets. That was cool as hell.\n\nSakura definitely redeemed herself in Shippuden or at least she did in my opinion.",
    "The three win. Loads of people say assume wins but he just doesn\u2019t. Yes Sasuke gets stomped easily but the only way Asuma can beat Naruto is by decapitating him. Naruto literally regenerated a fuckin hole in his stocmah.\n\nAnd fifth gate Lee is faster than Asuma.",
    "Every version of Sasuke up until Sasuke gets Six paths chakra/the Rinnegan.",
    "Obito is, for sure. The guy practically mind controlled a perfect Jinchuriki for years with one genjutsu.",
    "Naruto wins. His reserves are just too immense and if it\u2019s a battle to the death, Kurama will likely say the same thing to Naruto as he did Gaston Isshiki and then out comes Baryon Mode and Sasuke dies.\n\nHowever if Naruto doesn\u2019t want to kill Sasuke like how the other fights have been then Sasuke has a better chance.\n\nSasuke would likely have more chakra considering he was on several missions in the blank period meaning he likely had to fight on several occasions this would increase his reserves.\n\nHe\u2019d likely actually use the Rinnegan so he has an instant win condition in the form of the human path.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen Naruto deal with Amaterasu using his cloak and genjutsu is useful because of Kurama.\n\nI\u2019d say Naruto wins even this matchup simply because he can outlast Sasuke. His stats are better and he can likely just overwhelm Sasuke with clones so Sasuke can\u2019t use the human path on him.",
    "Makima for sure. Even without her power she\u2019s good looking and manipulative as fuck so she\u2019ll be great on the stand.",
    "I thought you got him as well. My first thought was he was cheating lol!\n\nYou just shot his shoulder. Unfortunate timing, no reason to get mad. Your aim was good he just crouched at the best time he could.",
    "Shadow and Skydiving",
    "Celestial sapien is easily the strongest but then again I don\u2019t want to share a body with someone else.\n\nSo Saiyan. Still look human, human shaped body and incredible power.",
    "That\u2019s it\u2019s about Ninjas",
    "https://preview.redd.it/gfkbq8i6b3ue1.jpeg?width=284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1713ca2d60dfde6f79c13b51040b32777e5c46b9\n\nKamatari is heavily underrated. I love this summon!",
    "If we talking about people who were alive at the time then I believe only really Might Gai and Obito.\n\nGai could likely beat pain at the 6th or 7th gate and Obito could phase through the Deva path technique and the chakra rods.",
    "Far Cry 3, 5, 4.",
    "This is fucking easy for Sakura! She absolutely molly wops Naruto. Even if Naruto used his cloak like in the original, she still wins.",
    "Drax sweeps bro. He stands still, goes invisible and then does a sneak attack, rinse and repeat. Easy dub!",
    "Highschool DxD. I hate Issei, I hate the fan service. I FUCKING LOVE THE WORLD. The story and the world is so goddman interesting but everywhere else you look it\u2019s just TITS and then some more TITS.\n\nThe whole Fallen Angel, Devil and Angel stuff with the wars and sacred gears. It is just so interesting to me but I can\u2019t stand the main protagonist and the over fixation with every female being naked for the waist up.",
    "I thought he became before the Arch. Don\u2019t know how to as spoilers so I\u2019ll just shorten the word",
    "Dude never said that. You\u2019re delusional",
    "That\u2019s why I included the part about if he had armament haki",
    "I think she does yeah. I think it\u2019s more a stamina limit, she can only rewind so many times before she gets tired.",
    "Even Luffy Gear 5? Sakazuki?",
    "Ah yeah fair enough",
    "Even with armament Haki?",
    "For sure. Wukong absolutely decimates most anime verses and character. The monkey reached nirvana and was dubbed \u201cThe Fighting Buddha\u201d.",
    "Kabuto wasn\u2019t a perfect sage at all! The hell you talking about?!\n\nThe only perfect snake sage is Mitsuki and that\u2019s debatable since it goes against everything we know about sage mode.",
    "Depends really. I doubt Sasuke would be a perfect sage so he\u2019d be more similar to Kabuto and his imperfect sage mode. He\u2019d be a lot stronger than he was with the curse mark though. Sage Mode is just a much better version of the curse mark.",
    "I don\u2019t know why everyone is downvoting you lol! I doubt she could match up to sage of six paths characters but everyone else including madara, Obito, Hashirama, Naruto. She beats.",
    "Sent you a chat request!\n\n\\-",
    "Boruto wins with ease. The Karma Marking is an absolutely op buff.",
    "Hashirama sweeps with ease. I don\u2019t even need to explain.",
    "We aren\u2019t fully sure why no one told him. Most people somehow couldn\u2019t make the obvious deduction he was. The only Uzumaki in Konoha was Kushina so people should\u2019ve definitely clicked he was Kushina\u2019s son and she was seen pregnant for 9 months. It should\u2019ve been obvious.\n\nNow as to why the people who knew didn\u2019t tell him. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because Minato has a shit load of enemies, the Hidden Stone for example that would want to kill Naruto as revenge.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t that good of a reason considering he has the name Uzumaki and is also a Jinchuriki so the target on his back can\u2019t really get any bigger.",
    "So let\u2019s talk about what I know. In my opinion from the characters I know Team Japan or Korea are taking this.\n\nI\u2019m going off the pictures so this is original series Ben 10. This is that version of a hulk which I believe is 616. So not like Worldbreker Hulk.\n\nTeam Japan first. Goku is of course strong but I\u2019m fairly sure Madoka and Rimuru end up or se stronger than this version of Goku which I believe is battle of gods. One punch Man is also quite powerful. I don\u2019t know much about Sonic, I know when he gets the chaos Gem, or whatever it\u2019s called, sonic turns into the white version and gains fucking reality warping to an extent but I\u2019m going off the image so I think they all just die.\n\n\nTeam America next. Obviously Ben 10 gets destroyed. This is original series who only has 10 aliens and none of them are as strong as the likes of feedback, alien x or atomix. \n\nBatman with one year of prep I don\u2019t matters at all. I think he gets destroyed by most of the opponents. Superman and Hulk are int he same boat cause I don\u2019t think the main timeline versions are that strong compared to some of there stronger versions like world break a hulk or prime one million superman.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Spawn except his name and I think SpongeBob\u2019s cartoon fuckery gets beat by some of the hax in this image.\n\nTeam Korea next. The obvious ones are Sung Jin Woo, Jin Mori or Sun Wukong. Now I haven\u2019t finished God Of Higschool so I can\u2019t say much about Jin Mori and I haven\u2019t finished solo levelling in awhile so I can\u2019t really comment on him but I do know both get pretty strong. I think around planetary.\n\nThe top right is the dude from Greatest Estate Developer, great read, go check it out. He isn\u2019t that strong at all, maybe building level or something like that.\n\nThe other two I have no idea who they are.\n\nFinally Team China. The leader is of course Game Sun Wukong as the OP said in another comment. So he doesn\u2019t just immediately murder everyone and become immortal another 3 times. The guy ends up becoming the fighting Buddha. He strains nirvana like Buddha which is just insane so thank god this isn\u2019t that Wukong.\n\nThe one on the bottom right is know but can\u2019t remember the name of the anime and also haven\u2019t watched much of it awnaywy so I can\u2019t comment.\n\nThe one on the middle right is Hajun who I think is supposed to be really strong but again I don\u2019t much about him so I can\u2019t comment.\n \nThe rest of them I have zero clue about.\n\n\n\nSo based on all of this, I think Team Japan wins.",
    "This is really cool! Well done!",
    "It\u2019s this video: https://youtu.be/y1qC8ZIe9Kc?si=eUyhV9yrZ65ASHYo\n\nEnjoy!",
    "They likely died in the first Shinobi world war. The war that took the life of a lot of incredibly powerful Kage level ninja. MOs Tod the villages lost two Kage in the first war. So it isn\u2019t really that surprising that we don\u2019t see Tsunade\u2019s parents, especially her father.\n\nAlso Hashirama and Mito\u2019s child would be a male because of how the marriage laws work. They follow the old world stuff so because Tsuande\u2019s last name is Senju then that likely means her father was a Senju because the bride usually takes the grooms name.\n\nNCHammer23 on YouTube actually made a great video about this very topic. Go check him out. I can\u2019t remember what the video name is however.",
    "Sent you a chat request!",
    "Same with me pal. I\u2019ll add you now!",
    "before I add you. What games did you want to play?",
    "Hello! Would love to play games or chat with you. You seem like a lovely person. I\u2019m 21M and British. The timezone isn\u2019t a problem since I tend to be up a lot later than usual because of the times i work.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to hear from you!",
    "We may be kindred souls lol! Spent around 400 hours playing Skyrim split between multiple steam accounts and probably spent 1000s modding the bloody game. The struggle is real!\n\nI love gaming, anime, movies, manga, writing stories, mountain biking and skydiving. I\u2019m British, 21M. Let me know if you want to chat!",
    "Hello bro! I\u2019m 21M and I\u2019d love to chat with you and play games. I\u2019m a PC gamer though and I would happily answer any random questions your mind can come up with! In fact the more random the better!\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to chat!",
    "Hello! I\u2019m Male, 21, British. I like gaming, reading manga, anime, movies tv shows. I\u2019m also into mountain biking and Skydiving (I have proof lol!). Let me know if you\u2019d like to play! I\u2019ll let you message me since you said you\u2019d prefer females!",
    "Hello! I love video games, would love to chat. I\u2019m looking for friends also! Would be down for watching almost anything lol!"
