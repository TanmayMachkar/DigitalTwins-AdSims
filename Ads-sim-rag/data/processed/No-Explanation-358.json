    "Aizen wins at that stage of the anime he is in posession of the hyogoku he hasnt infused with it yet i pressume that it woulnt take long for him to fuse with it of there was a significant treat but i think he can take madara with only his shikai form you are forgetting jere how truly powerful he truly is here once madara decides to block his sword its over",
    "In my personal opinion ichigo clears all of the naruto saga after becoming a shinigami. Everyone forgets he had quincy and hollow before coming a shinigami but after he became one he has the pre requisites to become the soul king just loel an arrancar's awakening he manifisted his sword without an asouchi of he goes down white will take over becoming a vasto lorde ichigo clears everyone mentioned except the one that can actually sence him that being madara of he posses the rinnegan and sasuke of he has rinegan. You are forgeting that soul reapers cant be seen by normal human all.of naruto are normal humans  lol",

    "No ongoin manga = stronger aint the truth im saying its hard to compared all of them on their strongest atleast luffy. As of someone that have watched all of Naruto, some of one piece havent reached gear five and seen what ichigo is accomplishment is i do have to say that Ichigo is currently the strongest out of the big 3 they do not posses a power to detect ichigo in his soul reaper form its like fighting your own ghost the one i think that would somewhat persive that ichigo is there os sasuke because the rinegan is that strong i dont think nature explample is when madara had his invisible clones st the ebd of the day chakrabaint that strong maybe naruto will have a chance againt luffy if he knows about salt water",

    "I watched all the big 3 narutonos the weakest as ot stands ichigo is the strongest of the 3 why becaise one piece keeps on going its hard to say how stronger he wil get in the future compared to gear 5 idk anything beyond gear 5 but ichigo would kill gear 5 luffy people dont take into account ichigo could of been the next soul king if ywach didnt fall",

Im a harcore fan of the desmond era when the game had an actual good story in my opinion thats the true form of an assasins creed formula. The game is called assasins creed for a reason after desmond died it feels like the templara just won and took over being stuck inside the animus 24/7 with no backlash kinda dumb what happened with the bleeding effect",

    "He didnt go cuz he thought the s ranks were strong enough to complete the jeju raid by themselves. Its understandable for him not wanting to go because he jist healed his mother yet he plased shadows on tge s rank hunters as a backup im willing to bet once the japanese hunyers started dying 1 by one thats when he decided to step in diring that point he told his sister and mother he had to step oit and on that scene when he is in the rooftop ot was game time because goto the s rank japanese hunter died",
