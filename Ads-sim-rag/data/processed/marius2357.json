I also really enjoy messing around with each difficulty slider to create more challenges to play with.\n\nRight now my main character is level 167 and has several guns, ships and outposts (with farming and animals) and I've not touched the main story at all after you do the first quest.",

Yet they attempt to kill anything that they see, disregarding all survival instincts in order to maul whatever is infront of them in the most gruesome way possible. \n\nPerhaps Pitbulls retain an inkling of the natural instinct to go after weaker prey, judging by alot of them seemingly preferring to attack small animals/children.

The Brotherhood was probably partially responsible for causing the downfall of Shady Sands in some way (why else would they be there in Maximus's flashbacks), after which Shady Sands probably tried to rebuild which is when the Overseer decided to nuke it.!<",

And in the credits of episode 8 we see the aftermath of a huge battle having taken place in New Vegas, but that still only kinda vaguely could explain why New Vegas is pretty different from its ingame counterpart. Also is everyone just gonna gloss over the fact that the Enclave still exists in a relatively stable condition somewhere in a snowy place? I don't think they just showed that for no reason.!<",
