    "It slowed down a little about 4-5 episodes in of S1, in my opinion, but overall, it's definitely a binge worthy anime.",
    "You're not OP so, your opinion doesn't really matter tbh",
    "It's been a while but I think the second season didn't review so well",
    "Based of this list maybe Sword Art Online",
    "Dexter & Ed",
    "![gif](giphy|0B981WvKRCiCk3vxny|downsized)",
    "8 feels balanced. Despite Tomura and Griffith, I feel safe enough with the others there ,so I can probably get some rest",
    "Judging by your list and some common themes between many of them, I would say Frieren and maybe Delicious In Dungeon",
    "One Piece. I thought the story was great in the beginning. I think at the time, I was watching so many anime that I just put it on the back burner. Now, even catching glimpses of it, the pacing seems antiquated. The art style is off-putting to me, like some characters are way too cartoony for my taste. And honestly, at this point in my life, I ain't watching all that",
    "I could see that God wanted to teach Satan a lesson but at the same time it does seem that he kinda gave up on the world at the end. I guess it plays into the whole idea of God having destroyed the world twice before and wouldn't do it again, so it was on us but we weren't winning that fight",
    "The context is easy to understand, and it was an incredibly beautiful anime from start to finish. The issue for me is it escalated so much and so quickly to get such a simple thing across. So the entire world had to be obliterated just so that Satan could realize he cared for his friend, who essentially expressed his care for Satan since they were kids? God could have intervened at any point before then, and in many different ways, I'm sure, but nah, let's just see how bad things get first. It was almost comedic",
    "It was between this and Devilman Crybaby for me. Both just have you like wtf at the end",
    "![gif](giphy|ygAmzS6qTOkzxG0VsB)\n\nDevilman Crybaby",
    "I remember this show. Yeah, it didn't blow up in the US, but Japan is crazy about it. It's literally been going on longer than One Piece. I was honestly shocked when I found it was still going a couple years ago. I think here it was called something different, though",
    "Yeah you're right, I'd say it's more controversial due to its ending.",
    "I personally would finish a chapter, then put it out. I think that would be the best for you and the audience. Your art is amazing, and as long as the story is good, you'll build a following. Once you put it out, you might feel like you need to keep up that momentum, but you shouldn't rush because then you might lose some of that great quality. Take your time with it",
    "Honest opinion. If you're putting out quality work like that, I wouldn't care how long it took. I dont think anyone will be pressed about your release schedule if you put it out as it's just you, so if that's what you're worried about, I wouldn't.",
    "![gif](giphy|ereDBohGYxXGM)",
    "Cena at Summerslam",
    "Man \"sauce\" is outdated now? I'm old \ud83e\udd72",
    "The 90s for me. Much like music during that time, it took what the 70s and 80s did but threw the formula out the window and pushed boundaries. I think the 2000s picked up that ball and kept it rolling though",
    "I wouldn't say rigged but definitely flawed. Having the most upvotes would be a good idea if downvoting weren't possible which is what has been happening",
    "Does Ryuk even count? If I recall Death Note, shinigami are only allowed to influence not actually do anything themselves, hence the whole plot of dropping the book to Light",
    "Ahh. I was thinking of the many moods of Koro-sensei, but yeah, I see it now lol. Nice",
    "One of my favorites as well",
    "Record of Ragnarok. They are basing it off that which he would easily kill Musashi",
    "I guess it would depend on the language, but Google Translate is historically known for giving some very weird translations between languages. If you're under some sort of time crunch, a competition possibly, then I would go for it. If not, I would say maybe look into getting a translator. Yeah, it will cost you, but it's better to have someone translate that would know how to convey your messages clearly to your audience",
    "Man why did I think the same thing. Like am I really that out of touch with anime or are these just really poor choices?",
    "![gif](giphy|ydyZ0KaHpiyGI)",
    "I agree and disagree. Yes, people talk and write every day, but not at the level it would take describe as much detail in a single panel of most manga. In fact, that type of writing is usually discouraged in most schools and professions unless one is enrolled in a creative writing course. Your example is almost like saying everyone can evoke the same emotion as Stephen King does when writing a horror novel because we do it every day. Casual conversation isn't the same because people get the gist of things through commonality, not because it's a high level.\n\n(BTW, this isn't an attack, and I agree with art being harder, but not everyone can articulate what their mind is perceiving, in that way, I find art is an easier medium than writing.)",
    "Nice. I got a big Casshern vibe from it. The action scenes were a bit difficult for me to follow but other than that it was great",
    "I'd be willing to help with writing. Im just getting back into drawing and my work is a far cry from what it used to be so I won't be as much help there",
    "It's a very easy concept to adapt despite what others have said. Personally, I'm not the type to take concepts from others, but if someone wanted to collab on it, I would definitely give some ides to help refine it",
    "Oh, I plan to one day. I've given up expecting to see it animated again, but it's such a huge tragedy that it got left where it did, although the reason is understandable.",
    "I'm glad there's still a few non-hive mind thinkers that actually acknowledge what Charlotte did for the women's division instead of just bashing her because its popular",
    "![gif](giphy|XdKPWBgoLgXNo7VJqY)",
    "While I agree art is hard in many ways, I find just as many good artists with recycled and lackluster stories as I do writers that can't draw. I have been on both sides, and to me, this argument is kind of silly, and the only reason I side with artist on this one is due to the fact that everyone should get paid for their work.",
    "I dont even know if the show is underrated or what, but I rarely ever see it mentioned on posts like these. Ouran was so good and no lie \"Shissou\" is one of the best ending themes ever",
    "Yeah. Unfortunately, that's the best I could do without being there with you to help. I understand from an artist perspective about the layers, but compressing all of that to a zip file is kind of crazy to me. Hopefully, everything works out for you",
    "So PDF does keep it in layers. Have you tried converting the PDF TO PSD? There may be some online converter you could use if you dont have software already.",
    "Okay. Im not familiar with Medibang but it says they allow you to export it to many different files: MDP (MediBang Paint's native), PNG, JPEG, PSD, WEBP, TIFF, GIF, BMP, and PSD for Print (CMYK). Have you tried exporting it to a file type other than PSD?",
    "What file type is the original file?",
    "Nicholas and Milly",
    "Any update OP? I can try to help if you still need assistance",
    "Baki's mother, Emi Akezawa",
    "Ouran High School Host Club",
    "In essence, I had to read what was the equivalent of a college level thesis paper to understand what was going on in FLCL when I was younger. So yeah...\n\n![gif](giphy|LvwiajC1uTcQM)",
    "Ah yes, Regular Show. It's anything but",
    "Loved this anime. Take my upvote",
    "Sure",
    "Terrible idea because you can't compare someone who has been pushed, actually given a good gimmick and working with creative to become regarded as a \"hot free agent\" to someone that hasn't despite them being at the best promotion.",
    "Ahh nice. A classic",

    "There was a gas station I used to go to on my way to/from work in Aberdeen that had a lot of the 2 liter bottles. Granted this was a year ago but if you're still looking",
    "I wouldn't feel too bad because their phones \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c",
    "I would say the best route for your son is to take Japanese in college and focus on his art. I have a friend who did just that and currently lives in Japan. Your son can be an art major and minor in Japanese while entering his work into contests",
    "I was just about to comment this. Like someone, ANYONE, FINISH THIS GEM OF AN ANIME!!!",
    "It doesn't. It's an item",
    "Can confirm MD is definitely not below $2.90. In most areas it's at least $3",
    "Yes, I love unknown. I haven't collected in years, but if I got back into it, I would want all the unknown cards",
    "Scalpers would find it really hard to make money off yugioh products because most players won't buy anything if it's too expensive. They will find a cheaper alternative or just wait for reprints and there are many YouTubers who make budget friendly decks. So no need to worry there",
    "Absolute gold \ud83d\ude02",
    "I made out Bingo Machine, GO!! so this must be what it's like to take a white lighting attack to the face",
    "Varar, if you have space, you could run 1, but it's honestly not necessary. You, more often than not, will sack your Zabufera for it, which isn't ideal. Creation was hit or miss, in my opinion, and I personally don't run it. Ereditare is the best of the three. 1 or 2 could work, but I'd try it at 1 first, depending on how you built your deck. I play fiendsmith with vaalmonica, and I don't think masterduel has lacrima, crimson tears yet still. (Haven't played for a bit, but I've been to Diamond 1 with Fiendsmith pairing)",
    "Now that's clean. Very amazing art",
    "I'd argue that Goldbergs is better simply off the impact delivered without the setup. He never needed to run the ropes multiple times or get a massive running start to get as much impact as Bron",
    "![gif](giphy|AD2uIPYVqszdK|downsized)",
    "As someone who has sold on whatnot and definitely spent a lot on the platform, I can tell you there are a lot of scams, but there are also a lot of good sellers on there as well. I was probably one of the more hated sellers due to the fact that I valued the cards way less than what the market was, but that was due to the fact that I needed money. Many of those streamers, with hundreds of viewers, have been there a while are dependent upon those sales. They are, in fact, resellers. I often avoided them unless there was a giveaway I could win or something like that. The key thing is knowing what you want and knowing its price. When streaming, or watching always have your computer and phone with you to have tcgplayer up so you don't get ripped off and if you're in a bidding war know where to stop where you're actually saving because shipping can still hurt. Also, avoid any huge giveaways, like a PS5, Ferrari (yes, I've seen that before), etc. because you're going to end up wasting a lot of money, win or lose\n\nEdit: Tl;dr: Know what you want, and don't buy into gimmicks",

    "Friend request sent",
    "Just traded for it but do you have any 3* from GA? I still need butterfree, poliwrath, hypno, magneton and snorlax",
    "You both replied at the same time. Im trading for it now but do have any 3* from GA. Still looking for butterfree, poliwrath, hypno",
    "Sure. Friend request sent",
    "I would say you need two Misty by default. Also how is Dawn working for you? I feel as though it's a waste tbh because you should have tatsu to float Dozo (main strat), and if you took time to load up Gyrados because he's active, let him stand for a whole to build Dozo.",
    "2738714544307700",
    "I just want a tinkaton, but that rainbow is awesome!",
    "There's nothing wrong with the app, and users telling you otherwise are lying. It's very simple to use, and yes, you can get many trades done. You can even watch a quick ad and get it filtered to see users who have what you want and are looking for what you have. Of course, usage drops because trade points run out quickly, but that's not the devs' fault. It will spike in use once again when SR becomes tradeable",
    "Drop Grunt. It's a good card when it works, terrible when it doesn't card so it's a waste. I'd remove the butterfree line. You're bloating your deck with it. Sprigatito wants his line to evolve or, at the least, grab Shyamin for healing early. Add another shyamin for all that and free some space. Add another joy (I know that's not her) and another shyamin, in my opinion. I would also put in 1 pokeball because it does come in handy. Maybe another red or at least Sabrina",
    "As someone who uses healing, no you're not using enough. I feel you issue might be some of the other cards you're using especially in Meowscarada.",
    "I can tell those defending this deck have never played Dragonite before. Otherwise, they wouldn't be talking about how many decisions they think it has. Try that deck first then come talk about decisions",
    "That's not true. There are plenty of other decks that don't need EX cards that are not Rampardos/Lucario. Meowscarada literally doesn't need an EX to beat Darkrai/Giratina, they can win with just Shyamin. Poison and confusion decks would likely be more prevalent. Even OG dragonite, which is literally the meta just not as fast",
    "Cena 9/10. Definitely holding back\n\nCody 8.5/10. Held his own but the childlike insults and the switch made it fall off",
    "These are actually not bad at all for one developing their own style. Truly, that is hard. I would suggest some of the classic how to draw manga books since you're already using some manga references. I used Pinterest a lot, too, as they have many how to draw profiles",
    "I completely forgot it was April Fools Day. Gotta be careful with these fake posts today",
    "Her credibility dropped due to others around her. You had Sonia Deville, who was terrible to watch with that mma gimmick. You have the other two horse woman of mma, not Ronda, who were on NXT TV, maybe like 4 times as a tag team that failed. Then you got Ronda, who completely eclipsed her despite cutting terrible promos and looking very rough in the ring at times. Shayna had it all going for her, but there were too many female mma fighters in wwe, and they all fumbled around her ruining what she built in NXT",
    "Shading and detailing, especially the hair and clothing. The inking is heavy as well but it's really telling the story that more subtle details could",
    "How has the flute been working out for you? I feel like that could be another cape or even a comm for setup when hand isn't ideal like a skarmory start with and no pidgey",
    "Plain usernames, no medals, usually low level, plays every color and runs into your druddigon with Rocky helmet without remorse? Yes",
    "Let her go bro. Take someone else. This is a huge red flag and a power play on her part. If you give in, it sets a precedent in how she can and likely will behave in the future. It may hurt, but you can't let anyone walk all over you like that",
    "Got that Pok\u00e9mon Yellow god pack. Nice!!",
    "Ngl I have been having a fun time with Meowscarada and Shyamin. Easy set up and enough healing to grind",
    "That's actually kind of cute with the little woopers on its back",
    "So it's a dragonite deck the way it should be minus the chip damage",

    "WWE is a business, so they go with what's popular. The sad truth is we will see a great wrestler like Gunther lose the title like many have lost in the past to what's popular, but it's for the sake of money. That's just the way it is",
    "Ngl, I personally wouldn't mind this pack at all. I love unknown,  I remember spending days wandering back and forth in the ruins of alph in Gold collecting all the unknown, hoping there was some crazy secret besides puzzles and trap doors. Imagine my disappointment back then \ud83e\udd72",

    "Do you have a Persian from GA? I'll trade the cape for that",
    "You've got potential. I see a lot of things that don't look too bad (shading, hair, and color) but definitely need to work on anatomy. From what Im guessing, the mouth is supposed to display focus, like a pose in battle, but the things in her teeth are flat in the image, so it looks awkward. Also, that arm seems angled a bit too high. Im an old fool, so it's painful for me to try to put my arm in that position, but I always recommend having a model or doing it yourself to get the idea of how it should look. Overall, you've got talent and are better than many I've seen. Keep up the good work",

    "I agree. Im just running a dragonite deck, and every single time I change a card, I get a fire energy because of druddigon. Hopefully, that's something that gets patched in the future",
    "Not really. I got all 4 stars as well. I would actually be upset if I got an immersive or crown because I already have them and would prefer the trade points for the next set tbh",
    "Yeah, anyone that's been watching E for a while could figure they were going with the Naomi attacked Jade angle. Giving the title to Liv and Raquel gives them a way to Mania and allows for Rhea to have a fresh opponent. Now it's a toss-up between Bayley, Alexa, and Roxanne",
    "Looks promising. Hate to be that internet guy, but there's a lot of redundancy in your wording mostly page 1",
    "No complaints about the artwork if the first page is a demonstration of your skills, but what are you needing critique of exactly? I can definitely say without context this very hard to critique storyboard wise",

    "Yes, older packs are still available. Look for the button that says '\"select other booster packs\" and look for Genetic Apex",
    "Maybe add the moment of them waking up like jolting up eyes wide open with sweat. Something to indicate maybe heavy breathing in the following panel, maybe before they look at their hands. I think that would be the ideal time to insert \"it was just dream\" would be while they are looking at their hands. I think missing the actual abrupt waking up is kind of the issue here. Just my opinion, though",
    "Nice. It's a bit dated, but man, is it fun trying to get Magnus out. If you do craft it, I suggest message in a bottle and seventh tachyon when it gets released in MD",
    "If just for solo mode or you could try super quant. It definitely takes a degree of skill, getting their boss monster Magnus out given some of the decks limitations. Plus it will give you a challenge facing some of the solo mode decks",
    "If you still want to trade we can. Just accepted your request",
    "That is interesting. I could see that working maybe a light beast-warrior. It would really help the deck with speed and not hurt it so much as now you don't have to worry about protecting your continuous spells and traps",
    "Ancient Warriors. Would love to have more than just the 1 Link-2. A link for each element and a couple modernized spells and traps would do the deck just right",

The trickiest part is getting Dimonno in grave for that extra light fiend for Desirae because no Lacrima",
    "I think it's just a Pok\u00e9mon thing. I recently started playing Pocket and joined the sub because I wanted to play another card game but one that wasn't as serious as Yugioh but didn't know where to start since I last played in maybe '99. Fast forward a bit, and all I see on this and the other Pok\u00e9mon subs suggested constantly is \"look at my shiny card.\" It's very odd to me as I'm used to talking strategy and deck building, but I guess this is the norm here",
