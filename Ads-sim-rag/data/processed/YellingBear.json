    "I\u2019d just lay it out straight.  They get ONE chance to prove you wrong.  If they blow that, it\u2019s non serious \u201cfly by the seat of your pants\u201d DM\u2019ing or they can fuck off and find a different group.",
    "Mistakes were clearly made. \ud83d\ude22",
    "Ouch.  The truth hurts",
    "You can just say \u201cI\u2019m out of practice and butt hurt that I can\u2019t face mash my way to an easy win\u201d.  Would be faster, and more honest then this.",
    "Per capita\u2026. Power fantasy/wish fulfillment.  They tend towards being very poorly written.",
    "Can only speak from seeing the anime. But it seemed like a solid take on the Isekai genre.",
    "It is rather fun.  But I do think some champions (mostly the scalers) need to be tweaked to make the game mode more fun.",
    "It doesn\u2019t though.  You simply proved my point.  You want specific rules from one verse to translate into another verse where that power system doesn\u2019t exist.  Thus all the (positive) rules now exist but none of the negative rules do.  \n\nBeyond that you have simply decided that power system A works, the same way in universe B as it did in A.  But of course power system B doesn\u2019t work in universe A, because your argument falls apart otherwise.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the need for equalization, it\u2019s about the fact that people cherry pick what they want to be true and then build arguments with the cherry picked information.  \n\nSo once more we circle back to my point.  \u201cThe verse I want to win; will always win because I\u2019ve decided what will and won\u2019t be accounted for.  This is a fair, balanced, and impartial ruling and how dare you disagree with me\u201d /s",
    "You piss and moan about my replies but refuse to prove any of your statements.  Your entire argument boils down to my point.  \u201cI want X to be true, and because there is no cannon definitive proof otherwise, X is now true; and fuck you for suggesting otherwise\u201d\n\nWe all agree that power systems need some level of equalizing.  Or else the power system of which ever world the fight is taking place in, will always win.  Bleach loses to Black Clover because the power system of Bleach doesn\u2019t exist in that media.  Thus soul reapers instantly die once they leave their world.  Quid pro quo Asta is stronger than Ichigo.   Fuck it, the power system doesn\u2019t exist in Baki either.  So the character with no super powers is stronger than the character with super powers (who is show to be able to cut mountains in half).\n\nThat\u2019s not the issue I\u2019m addressing though.  I\u2019m addressing the shit tier explaining authors do about how their power systems work and what the limits are.  Again, because they are almost always based off \u201cthe rule of cool\u201d instead of a definitive rule set.\n\nThat is why power scaling verse to verse is fucking stupid and pointless.  Even if you allow the power systems to interact with each other, the durability, stamina, power, ect\u2026 are never defined.  So everyone is firing off endless versions of their most powerful attacks, at all times, forever.",
    "I personally would have preferred a story where he\u2019s older once everything starts to happen.  I think it would be interesting to see Steven have to deal with some of the stuff minus homeworld getting involved and minus the sudden power-ups that came along with that",
    "You claim that Ichigo can\u2019t be touched?  Why?  We have seen him be physically touched by humans.  We have seen Goku physically punch a literal god.  So what is stopping him from punching Ichigo?\n\nAlso how does one \u201cfairly\u201d equalize different powers?  Does the one shot gag comic where Usopp solos all the others verses count as canon? Or does the one shot gag manga where Kiba wins a fight against Hit, suddenly mean that several Naruto character are now \u201ccanonically\u201d multiple times faster then light/immune to time manipulation?\n\nThe biggest issue with trying to scale this shit is that anime works off the \u201crule off cool\u201d instead of a quantifiable power system.  How much \u2018resource\u2019 does (character) have?  How much of that resource does (signature attack) use? How much damage does that attack do?  How durable is (character); IE how many of that attack should they be able to withstand?  I mean fuck, we see Goku literally breaking reality trading punches with Berrus.  Then we later see Goku (in a stronger form) trading punches with multiple other characters and those blows aren\u2019t even a fraction as impactful.",
    " /shrug\n\nMost people vastly over state how strong any given character is.  It\u2019s super rare that we ever see a character \u201cgo all out\u201d, but people love to claim that such and such could totally do whatever.  If character were ACTUALLY even a fraction as strong as people claim; most works fall apart instantly.\n\nHell lets use Bleach as an example.  You have multiple character who are stated to be able to do insane shit.  But you never see them actually do anything close to that.  Like they wank squad 0 to be sooooo strong, but what are we really talking?  A couple buildings? A few city blocks?  Despite claims that it should be destroying an entire universe (or what ever a dimension actually translates to).\n\nI mean fuck point at Naruto and the multiple characters who people claim can wipe out entire continents.  And yet ninjas are shlubs who need to be hired to do random bullshit (instead of fucking using their powers to rule the world)",
    "The sheer lack of people pointing out that she \u201cnormalizes\u201d. CONSIDERABLY. By the time \u2018All Grown Up\u2019 takes place, is kind of weird.  \n\nLike we KNOW that she\u2019s a decent person as a teen.",
    "Correct me if I\u2019m wrong.  But don\u2019t we already know that Angelica becomes a decent person?\n\nLike I\u2019m pretty sure in the sequel series, she\u2019s CONSIDERABLY less spoiled.  She\u2019s not some beacon of kindness and generosity, but she\u2019s by no means a menace.",
    "Thank you for clarification.  \n\nNo, he\u2019s strong but 100 people who are even remotely smart and organized, would win.",
    "I have read and watch it.  And of course it\u2019s a gross over simplification.  I have better things to do with my life then write a small book explaining why I found the series to be unappealing of a second go through.\n\nBut \u201crespectfully\u201d I\u2019m getting strong \u2018terminally online\u2019 vibes from this conversation.",
    "At once or one at a time?  If one at a time, how much down time do they get between rounds?",
    "And that would be a problem why?  I mean other than it makes it harder to wank counter matchups.",
    "How what?\n\nThe story is bad.  A huge chunk of it is literally just a metaphor to the author trying to force reconciliation with his brother.  An abnormally large amount of the story is filler or deus ex machina reasons that character X, Y, or Z survived \u201cthis or that event\u201d.  The ending screams \u201coh shit I wrote myself into a corner\u2026. Time to pull the most random shit out of my ass\u2026.\u201d  Not to mention the absolute let down that was \u201cand then it turned out that the two strongest characters were literally the current reincarnations of theses 2 gods.  Fuck achieving your goal through hard work, bloodlines BABY\u201d",
    "But don\u2019t you know.  \n\nWhenever you equalize across verses, the verse I support always comes out ahead.  It\u2019s the rules.  /s",
    "I disagree.  But then I just can\u2019t stand Naruto whenever I\u2019be tried to go back through it.  The power level fluctuates so vastly that it\u2019s damn near impossible.  And the over arching story was just so poorly written.",
    "Sad but true",
    "To me the question honestly is just \u201cwhy do you think a different actress would have done any better?\u201d\n\nLike how much of the issue is ACTUALLY the actress?  And how much of it is dog shit writing and direction?",
    "Not the actual issue.\n\nAI has become \u201cgood enough\u201d that a lot of not AI is still getting flagged as AI.  Combo that with \u201cwriters\u201d that \u201cknow\u201d what is and is not AI, and everything starts to look suspect.",
    "I think it comes down to the difference between the silent majority vs. the vocal minority.  Well that and Riot not wanting to keep 3 dozen+ game modes active at all times.  \n\nLike I personally loved the bullet heaven game mode.  But wasn\u2019t all that surprised when it went away.",
    "It\u2019s \u201cadorable\u201d that you immediately backpedal once I put the burden of proof onto you.\n\nAlso \u201cso cute\u201d that you are so wrong that you have to try and put words into my mouth.  I never said it flopped, I said it wasn\u2019t as popular as people on this forum pretend.\n\nBut do PLEASE tell me all about this skin you BOUGHT for the sole purpose of using it in arena (and I do mean ONLY FOR ARENA).",
    "Great reply.\n\nI know it\u2019s sarcasm, but damn if the downvotes don\u2019t make it clear that some people honestly hold that view point.",
    "The game mode was not as popular as people want to make believe.  On the extreme off chance it does come back, it will likely end up \u201cmore balanced\u201d which will almost certainly mean that even less people will enjoy it.  \n\nAlso if you are going to pretend the mode was a viable financial path, then it\u2019s on YOU to prove that.  Not on others to prove you wrong.",
    "Yes\u2026 was that not clear in my first reply?\n\nI am happy that the mode is dead and that we can all move on to exploring other rotating game modes.\n\nIt does not affect me in the least that a niche game mode has once more come and gone.  And honestly I think the people throwing a tantrum over it are quite sad individuals",
    "Because they don\u2019t want to keep 3 dozen game modes active at all times.\n\nAlso as an aside.  Let\u2019s be honest Riot doesn\u2019t fucking care dude.  If you are ONLY playing arena chances are VERY high that you aren\u2019t investing into skins.  So why do you think anyone, much less the company, is going to care if you continue to play or not?",
    "I personally am happy that Arena is dead.  The game mode was not enjoyable.",
    "I\u2019m fine with that.  Make the MC work for that shit.  Bonus points if they end up abnormally strong (OP), instead of god tier (OP)",
    "I\u2019ve never understood this take.  Like you can simply not put your MC up against something they have zero chance of dealing with.  You can make them suffer without it being torture porn.\n\nI think a lot of it just comes down to people having less and less patients/attention span.  It honestly quite sad that most stories can even spend an episode or 3 building the MC up.  They have to be full wish fulfillment by minute 10 or the whole thing is \u201cunwatchable\u201d",
    "Why not both.  Have a MC who has all the tools to be overpowers as hell.  Then make them never use that power and suffer as they slowly fulfill their destiny.",
    "Yes",
    "So honest question\u2026 is her acting bad, or is she being given bad lines and poor direction?\n\nI mean fuck.  You could make Morgan Freeman look like a 3rd rate community theater performer with shitty enough lines and directions.",
    "You really should have posted the side by side for this.  Always a pain in the ass to deal with meta commentary that requires one to understand inside jokes.",
    "Sad but true",
    "Proficient in what?  Becuase the guy who remade the universe feels like the winner\u2026 even if that had very little to actually do with fire powers.",
    "But does the anime LET him just do that?  Or do \u201cwacky hijinks\u201d keep causing him to bust out his OP abilities?",
    "Things that jump to mind:  solo leveling, tbate, eminence in shadow.  I\u2019m sure there are more examples\u2026",
    "I think her original version was fine-ish\u2026 I mean as a support, who was tied to the ADC, she was fine.  Problem was that she rarely stayed on the support; and honestly fuck the bruiser + Yuumi meta.  That shit was toxic as fuck.",
    "I didn\u2019t care for it.  Story was weak, art was mid, MC is duller then dish water.\n\nHonestly don\u2019t get why some people seem to enjoy trash so much.",
    "I personally made my gods very human.  They are petty beings that would do anything to survive.  Even if that means damning countless souls to eternal torment, if it meant they didn\u2019t have to risk challenging something that posed an actual risk to their divinity. \n\nAn act they have done many times before\u2026 but the most recent time hit a bit of a snag.  The morals didn\u2019t die, and what\u2019s worse.  One of them took the whole abandonment thing rather personally.",
    "She doesn\u2019t need to be tanky, she simply needs to be tankier.  IE: she loses the 1 to 1 trade, but no longer needs to go 2+ to 1 to get ahead.",
    "I feel like Fujitora wins.  But it\u2019s based a lot more on his DF than anything else.  Like I expect less raining meteors, and more \u201cfloat bitch\u201d",
    "If only she had the survivability, mobility, and/or damage to be a bruiser.  I\u2019m all for being punished if caught.  But strongly believe it should be harder to catch Sona.\n\nHer E sounds nice, but her low base speed means that a large number of champions can simply run you down.",
    "Your mansplaining is painful and sad.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be safe, she needs to be able to do her job (pop in and out of combat range to buff her team and use her powercords) without being at major risk any and every time she does it.\n\nIt is a design flaw to make her squishy, and slow.  While also requiring her to be so close to combat.  You don\u2019t build a skirmisher type champion who is squishy, slow, AND weak.  You pick 1 (maybe 2) of those and let them excel at the other(s).",
    "\u2026. You literally gave the reason she needs to be \u201cweak\u201d in your post.  Assassins should not have incredibly high survivability.  You get one or the other.",
    "It leaned too heavy into \u201cthe joke\u201d for me.  Made it just as unwatchable as if it was playing the whole thing straight.",
    "Generally speaking the more money you have, the more able you are to interact with your kids (or hire someone to interact with your kids).  When you\u2019re not burned out from work, it\u2019s a lot easier to spend the energy.",
    "I\u2019m going to throw Sona out there.  Her kit is designed as a back row support, but her ranges (and most of her power) requires her to be a mid range skirmisher.",
    "Perhaps.  There is unfortunately a large group of people in this sub who become very unhappy when you suggest their escapist power fantasy MC would be better if they lost now and then.",
    "It\u2019s \u201ccute\u201d how much people are dogpiling this comment section.",
    "Not going to lie, I would greatly enjoy seeing him get his bone-y ass absolutely handed to him.  Like real \u201cstripped of protagonist privileges\u201d humbled like a basic bitch, levels of ass whooping.",
    "Steal feels the most balanced, spirit talker MIGHT be good but it\u2019s hard to tell with its user.  All the others bore the shit out of me.  \n\nOverpowered abilities almost always make shows become unwatchable.",
    "I\u2019m confused by the question.  Do the gems show up at/around the Stone Age for these alt earths?  Or are we talking \u201cmodern\u201d day versions of these earth and putting them up against the gems?",
    "Figured the people who knew, would know\u2026 also kept messing up her name with the other small child from that arc.",
    "Not really.  I honestly didn\u2019t like what I saw.\n\nI found the thing to be cringe (and not in that \u201cso bad it loops back to being good\u201d kind of way.).",
    "Who said anything about \u201ctalking nicely\u201d. The character\u2019s DF power canonically lets them tame animals (even if the animal doesn\u2019t want to be tamed).",
    "Is it funny that a Yonko probably couldn\u2019t tame the nine tails,  but an 8 year old child almost certainly could.",
    "Kira and Hisoka both feel like safe bets.  I\u2019m not liable to go digging into Kira\u2019s secret life and I\u2019m not strong enough to draw Hisoka\u2019s attention.  I expect both of them would be more than willing to put up with a loveless marriage for a year.",
    "Bit of A, bit of B.  To close to home and too \u201cnormal\u201d and no one can tell it\u2019s dystopian.  Too cartoonish and the message falls a bit flat.  Very few people want to find out that your medieval world is just a post apocalyptic location\u2026. Even more so when that doesn\u2019t come to light till book 3+",
    "Feels like a catch 22 problem.  If there is no issue, why is it being brought up at all?  But if it\u2019s brought up, then there must be an issue that is being addressed.",
    "It\u2019s a bit of the story being \u201ctoo believable\u201d.  (By which I mean just a lot of detail, that honestly could probably be glossed over and left to the readers imagination)\n\nBut I guess that\u2019s one of the issues when you tend to think in pictures instead of in words.",
    "This is surprisingly helpful.  A part of me has been very worried about that massive amount I\u2019m probably going to end up cutting; simply because it\u2019s more background details.",
    "Unfortunately I can not give you all of this.   If you have consumed enough media, then you will see through all the inspirations.  We have reached a point where creating something really and truly \u201cnew\u201d is almost impossible.  Someone, somewhere has done \u201cthe thing\u201d before.\n\nThat said, I still think the idea has legs.  Most stories I\u2019ve come across simplify there characters.  The \u201cgood guy\u201d is always good and always does the right thing.  You never have to sit with the fact that they just butchered a dozen+ living, breathing, thinking beings.  Beings who had lives and loved ones.  You never have to sit with the fact that the only reason those beings died, was because the MC was fed information that may (or may not) have been true.\n\nAs for the gamer thing.  I\u2019m under the impression that most people are willing to do HORRIBLE things in a video game, that they would never dream of doing in real life.  Sometimes it\u2019s \u201cfor the greater good\u201d but not an insignificant amount of times, it\u2019s simply because they are curious or bored.  Along with a whole host of other reasons they do or don\u2019t do things in a variety of games.",
    "The demon lord does end up meeting the cult that worships his previous incarnation\u2026. He takes poorly to it.\n\nAs for the hero, gross is a bit of the point.  His actions are a bit of a callout on those who take a \u201cso long as the people aren\u2019t real, I\u2019m allowed to do whatever I want; and no one is allowed to shame me for it\u201d view of fantasy.",
    "I\u2019m hoping the take on the harem trope plays a bit better.  It\u2019s less a harem and more of an interwoven web of alliances sealed by marriage/adoption\u2026 just all to the same guy.",
    "Parents are a high priest of the small town and the highest local level adventurer.  Story doesn\u2019t overly focus on them, but you make a good point.  If they are going to be important for the first arc they probably need to be fleshed out into more then 1D characters.",
    "Less cocky and a lot more accidental murder.  But you\u2019re not that far off (from what I remember of that show)",
    "Half right.  The hero and the demon lord are actually brothers.  They just see different paths to the same (perceived) end goal.",
    "It could be interesting.  I just prefer the idea that most of the MC\u2019s (demon lord) problems literally just cycle back to the fact that he exists.  \n\nKind of a \u201cwhat if the anti christ could humanly create world peace and end hunger\u2026 but no one will listen to him because they know he\u2019s the fucking anti christ\u201d",
    "I found that show to be unwatchable.  Just couldn\u2019t stand the MC.",
    "\u201cGood guy\u201d is relative\u2026 they both are doing what they think is right.  But they both end up with a sizeable corpse count by the end of the story.  The biggest difference is how they each feel about that fact.",
    "How do you feel about overpowered baby, who almost instantly misuses their power and suffers egregious consequences?  Like falls into a coma and loses control of their body for the better part of two decades, kind of consequences.",
    "I\u2019m going to count that as a vote for team Demon lord.  \n\nIt\u2019s a bit murky though.  They both start off overpowered.  They both struggle (just in very different ways).",
    "I think you hit that pretty squarely on the head\u2026 real shame that that\u2019s exactly why the series is unwatchable trash (to me at least).  Overpowered characters in serious series almost always kills any and all enjoyment of the series."
