    "No problem. But if you ever think about buying the physical manga, let me go ahead and answer the question you'll have. Yes the deluxe editions are well worth it. Don't waste any money on regular volumes.",
    "It does totally change the experience and also the anime doesn't even cover half the story. If you can't get the deluxe volumes because they're too expensive, then make sure you read on a big screen like a computer monitor or even two screens. A phone doesn't do it justice either and it's harder to follow on such a small screen.",
    "Yeah i guess it's because there's a lot of the community that never read the manga so for them the story kind of stops at the eclipse. You might be one of those people idk, but tbh there's kind of two berserk communities, the ones who only know the story up to the eclipse, and the ones who are actually into berserk and the whole story so far.",
    "How is that crazy? The eclipse happened early in the story.",
    "Sounds more like absolomb or something",
    "At my first job I had a coworker who was also into anime/manga and he had the deluxe volume with rape horse and showed me it to be edgy.",
    "Nice man!",
    "Damn really only 30 not 45?",
    "Since I'm gonna see them with my wife and lune reminds us of eachother, I'd say Lune for sure. Also I think coheeds crowd might like that one more anyways.",
    "I think it's not as bad as a lot of meshuggah fans make it seem.",
    "That's why it's my favorite too.",
    "Exactly",
    "Why?",
    "Periphery is heavier than mastodon",
    "So if someone is living in sin, it's loving to not try to get them to stop? I'm not saying be too harsh or anything.",
    "Is it love to accept their sin?",
    "No, it's obviously Nina.",
    "Well good job man, keep it up. At least you care.",
    "They're probably just average, especially if op is young unfortunately...",
    "Read",
    "He probably has super high t",
    "Why what happened to the nomad? I find their pants to be really good.",
    "I would recommend you try it. Especially with an icon or if you can't get ahold of an icon then print out an image of one and put it on your wall. I like the Sinai Pantocrator and when in this situation, i look at the right side predominantly. Bow/kneel before him as you pray, and realize that your King and God is really there watching you. I like to pray some of the psalms as well such as psalm 53. You will probably still be a sinner your whole life, but if you really want to defeat this demon of lust try out what I'm telling you, it helped me.",
    "I feel you brother, I am weak also and have had the same addiction but for 11 or 12 years. Can you answer my question though? So you feel the urge to look at something pornographic, then you pray the orthodox way, then you still feel that urge and act on it? Or have you not tried praying right when you feel the urge?",
    "What I'm referring to is praying before an image/icon of Christ and possibly saints/Theotokos, including physical movement like bowing, kneeling, and prostrating.",
    "So you want to look at something, then you pray and bow/prostrate before Jesus, and then right after you still want to?",
    "Any time you're about to look at something, pray first. Pray the orthodox way.",
    "Every other systematic theology has contradictions.",
    "Do you pray the orthodox way?",
    "Hahaha grew up in music classes so yeah I guess I am.",
    "Yeah it was a great transition with the ritardando at the end of Lethargica!",
    "Okay because that's really why I was saying I want this tour's live version, I love the way they slowed it down. I'll check out the others and see.",
    "Oh thanks I didn't know that, is it slowed down on those versions as it was on this tour?",
    "This can be most underrated overall but let reptile win.",
    "If you're broke but have access to a printer that you don't have to buy ink for, you can print out digital pages.",
    "Well then it really just depends on how far you are from them for weather you'll hear them gobble or not. Do you know about how far you are from where you think they roost or fly down to?",
    "Who knows maybe the lord could speak to a pope so strongly that he realizes the error and as the head of the catholic church, renounces all of the errors and comes back into the fold.",
    "If you've been going out just this past week when it's been overcast, they've been quiet where I'm at in east alabama. They're more vocal when it's clear skies.",
    "Seriously listen to those two parts and imagine some intense scene from berserk. Just fits so well. Those aren't the only two songs btw, just for easy intro.",
    "Meshuggah. For a bit of an easy intro listen to \"Born In Dissonance\" from 3:40 to the end and \"Phantoms\" from 3:00 to the end. Although to me their entire discography fits with berserk, the moments with the melancholic ambient guitar in the background are the ones that most fit with it.",
    "Everyone assumes there is a God when they view anything as right and wrong or true and false. There has to be a God for those things to exist. So if you think it's easier to deny God than affirm him, then you're also saying it's easier to deny truth and ethics/morals.",
    "1st time for me was in Atlanta last week. Been listening to them for a couple years now. It kind of makes me sad how good they are live considering they probably won't tour much more and I got in so late.",
    "Wow",
    "All sexual activity outside of a heterosexual marriage is a sin according to the church so if you want to join the church you're going to have to accept that.",
    "So what did you think?",
    "Wow it just goes to show how really subjective it is. I like the gods must be crazy way more than Ji and its not even close.",
    "What should've been worse other than epoch?",
    "Bro are you serious?",
    "Looks like I'll be voting hell below for underrated.",
    "Opeth",
    "Deluxe",
    "Chaos AD",
    "They like to be treated like children.",
    "Read the manga.",
    "Horror isn't objectively wrong/bad/evil though without God.",
    "When in this process would you season them?",
    "Do a lot of gay people eat chicken wings? I know this gay dude who likes chicken wings so it makes me think it's kind of a gay thing.",
    "You mean it was a joke or it was a reference to periphery?",
    "I think nowadays it's mostly a joke about the people who see the three dots and actually think it's a reference to periphery when in almost all cases it's not.",
    "I'll probably get called misogynistic but to me, betrayal, vainglory, and the desire for power, is a feminine thing. The men who are like that throughout history are feminine men. Masculinity still has emotions, it's just what you do with those emotions is the question.",
    "Yes! It's fun to cover up one half at a time.",
    "Polar kipper snacks for sure.",
    "Work on yourself to be the best Christian you can be, either married life or monastery life will naturally follow afterwards. Just devote all your focus on living the faith for now.",
    "He isn't related by blood to Petrucci. Maybe it's contagious.",
    "Yeah atropos is one of my favorite songs of theirs and I like it much better than wildfire, but the outcome of wildfire with the horn and the Orchestra leading right into the opening riff of atropos is just so good to me",
    "I'm really surprised that since you like combos, you put atropos alone instead of doing wildfire/atropos.",
    "How do you know which decisions by the councils were perfectly guided by the Holy Spirit, and which ones weren't?",
    "The Bible you say is infallible was produced by a church that you say is fallible.",
    "Very nice, I personally would like the pineapples cut a little smaller but those flavor combinations are great!",
    "Would you recommend those expensive earplugs that let you hesr the sound better, or no earplugs at all?",
    "Yes",
    "It depends on how you think about things. Some people should start with the NT, some should start with parts of the OT.",
    "I think the OT is relevant for Christians too. Obviously there's the prophecies of Christ. It is also important for understanding the covenants mentioned in the new testament such as the covenant with Noah and the Melchizedek priesthood, both gentiles. It also is important for refuting anyone that says the trinity is a new testament invention, since the trinity is present throughout the old testament. Also, obviously the psalms, which are part of orthodox prayer, and the wisdom texts, are all relevant to living a Christian life.",
    "Lust of any kind is a sin, sexual acts outside of marriage is a sin, and marriage is between a man and woman. That's really all there is to it.",
    "Haha yeah I started metal with that type of stuff too. After getting into periphery, have you found other bands that have fresh and new sounding music to you as well?",
    "What part of what I said is condescending?",
    "To understand where I'm coming from brother, check out Saint John Chrysostom's homily on this passage.",
    "Yeah its not explicitly stated in the Bible that gluttony is a sin against your own body. But as people mentioned above, it doesn't explicity state that drug abuse and self harm is either. As an Eastern Orthodox yourself, you should know that not everything is explicitly stated in the Bible.",
    "They probably do not.",
    "Repent, pray. Be a celebrate monk or pray to God to help you get back to the way he created us.",
    "I don't think it's the only one. Gluttony is harmful to your own body too.",
    "Did you listen to other metal before periphery?",
    "When I'm reading the manga I like silence because it helps me imagine all the sounds and effects happening in the story. When I'm just contemplating about berserk or berserk related things, my favorite is probably Meshuggah.",
    "Good job man keep it up!",
    "You're good to go then man.",
    "I disagree",
    "Farnese basically says in that chapter that she was scared of demons/scary beings so she decided to join them and lead them, which gave her pleasure.",
    "Meshuggah",
    "One of my favorites.",
    "Mustard",
    "Immutable is my favorite album of theirs so idk you tell me.",
    "Polar smoked sardines or polar smoked herring kipper snacks.",
    "Sasori",
    "Oh yeah true.",
    "You like dem choppas yahud?",
    "Yeah he's in the end of volume 1 with the rest of the god hand. But I also think this is bait since it shows Griffith as femto and shows him as a bad guy along with the rest of the god hand.",
    "1,000,000,000",
    "So cringe",
    "Erised through Masamune",
    "O'Charley's",
    "Check out Be'lakor in a couple years.",
    "I got one for duck and I was wondering if it would be good for turkey. Do you must use the full choke that came with it?",
    "Yes, it's some of the best art you'll see in a manga too if you care about that.",
    "Have you tried really going slow reading it and imagining what you're seeing and the sound effects and such?",
    "I guess it depends on what you mean by heavy.",
    "Gotta be 3 or 7.",
    "I hope they play for a decent amount of time on that tour.",
    "Thank you for the compliment but sadness and depression are two different things. So unless everyone saying Beserk makes them depressed actually mean sad,  no I don't understand them.",
    "What I mean is that catch 33 is basically one long song like I.",
    "It's a song",
    "Nice man, Tribe is a great vibe. We've got the jazz is one of my favorites.",
    "Everything is Fine! Particularly the first 42 seconds.",
    "Raped to death",
    "Danny Carey, Thomas Haake, Matt Garstka",
    "Why do you say the sxp is unreliable? Mines been as reliable as it gets. I think if OP can find a benelli around the same price he should get that, but if not, the sxp is a great gun for the price.",
    "The Demons Name Is Surveillance is my go to when angry.",
    "Yeah you would want to use the full for turkey. The other two are for duck and quail and such.",
    "Some people marry them",
    "I think Griffith is certainly comparable to the anti christ yeah.",
    "Haha yeah I've noticed that too.",
    "Why is that?",
    "But since they're double sided doesn't that mean you have to choose your favorite of the 2 for almost all of them?",
    "Also why shouldn't the greatest piece of fiction be spread to the masses?",
    "Because I want to hear the sounds that go along with such fantastic imagery.",
    "Kind of yeah, very realistic about the human experience as a whole from what you mentioned to emotion to how there's things going on that we can't always see but maybe sometimes can. I also find it very realistic about the demonic and how it operates. Also how some people can see them and struggle against them while many others stay very ignorant of them until they show themselves clearly and affect their lives directly.",
    "I've never read Macbeth but you make me want to",
    "I know it sounds weird but to me it's one of the most realistic manga I've read.",
    "I was just saying that your words were, how can we ask for guidance when she isn't all knowing, but we ask for guidance from non all knowing beings all the time.",
    "You don't think saints or elders or family can give you guidance?",
    "He has lust for Guts and wants to make him his. That's not love.",
    "No",
    "It's interesting how you have Meshuggah as number 1 but there's hardly any closely related bands on this list.",
    "The first metal song i ever liked as a kid was \"The Metal\" by Tenacious D",
    "It's probably the most enjoyable way to read berserk amd it immerses you in the world more so if that's worth it to you then yeah.",
    "What do you mean by more to it? Shouldn't you just keep reading to see what happens? Read volume 9",
    "Lucy is always so far down on the list.",
    "Go slow and enjoy every panel.",
    "1. Berserk 2.Rurouni Kenshin 3. Vinland Saga 4. Code Geass 5. One piece",
    "But there were apostles before the tree?",
    "The Southeast has them at costco too if you're ever in that area as well.",
    "Yeah I don't listen while reading.",
    "Yes but for Berserk vibes I like the band Meshuggah more. The drummer of TOOL is influenced by the drummer of Meshuggah too.",
    "If he really likes the berserk manga and reads it, then deluxe is worth it for him. It's the best way to read berserk imo.",
    "Be'lakor and Shadow of Intent (just their instrumentals)",
    "Yes",
    "Guts, Luffy, Himura Kenshin.",
    "My memory is hazy, how did he indirectly do those things? I know grunbeld and zodd were directly involved",
    "Are you trolling?",
    "Never heard of Erra and I'm from bham! After listening to 5 or 6 songs just now, I'm tenthing them.",
    "Nice post",
    "Please do not read it fast.",
    "How is the orion? Never been there but I hope the sound is good enough to hear all the little details in periphery.",
    "https://preview.redd.it/jvw1u95rai6e1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=999f0a61852448c790ae621d02e4cd66bbcf4fa4",
    "Everything by Be'lakor, and all the instrumental versions from Shadow of Intent.",
    "Mind linking the recipe?",
    "Why do you say JD is a false prophet?",
    "Exactlt",
    "You hunt",
    "2 hours is what I do.",
    "Thanks!",
    "This is the essence of berserk",
    "Uhhh i think you mean like 2,000lb. Most people can squat 200lb with not that much training.",
    "If you buy the 14th volume of the deluxe edition it has the guidebook in the back half after the last chapter.",
    "That'd be his Vastus Medialis.",
    "Polar smoked herring (kipper snacks)"
