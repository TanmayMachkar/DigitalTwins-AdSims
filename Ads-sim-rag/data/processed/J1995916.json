    "I loved seeing them add subtitles when the Pok\u00e9mon were talking to each other. It adds so much depth into their characters it's actually insane. Like I never knew Bulbasaur was so edgy or how much of a goof Squirtle was.",

    "Yeah I'm still looking my attic for that shadowless 1st edition charizard. I'm sure I'll find it one day",

    "V j",
    "I'm only silver so what do i know, but Amumu has been great for me. Went from iron to silver with mostly him. I realized I needed to take him because no one seems to want to play a tank or engage. His ultimate has single handedly decided a handful of games for me.",
    "They can beat any 2 person combo made of the gokage. Maybe 3 depending on which 3",
    "It's like duelist kingdom in yugioh. It's an extreme bastardization of the rules, but you still love it and it has its own unique charm to it",
    "Yeah i wanted to get some 151 but couldn't find any so i literally just went and bought every IR in the set and then some for the price of a single scalped premium collection",
    "I gave up buying from retail stores. Just go to local card shop or go online and buy singles. It's basically the best way to do it these days",
    "He stalemates with Hidan at best. Hidan can't kill the clone, but the clone can't kill Hidan either. Every other member of the akatsuki wins.",
    "He does not which is why it's a good thing he didn't fight a genjutsu user",

    "That's, sadly, still one of the best seasons we've ever had",
    "I never had confidence in a jig and saw a tacticalbassin video where they recommended this jig to get your confidence up. Let's just say i always have a jig tied on now.",
    "Nah bro Tim Donaghy is on our side if anything. He's the whistle blower. The refs he indirectly accused of betting were dick bavetta,  Bob Delaney, and Ted Bernhadt. He did not ref that game",
    "Elo hell is so 2014. It's all about loser's queue now",
    "He lost the fight but he still won in his own way. He wanted to prove to everyone that he could be a splendid ninja even without ninjutsu or genjutsu. That was his nindo, his dream, his goal. He proved it to every9ne that day.",
    "When i first started playing i mained top for years and Darius became my favorite champion. I switched to jungle because I liked the role more due to it having more agency and it being more fun. \n\n\nWhen I heard Darius was now a viable jungle option I was estatic. I've played him a few games jungle and have a fairly good win rate on him. I will say this. \n\n\nHis clear speed in absolutely insane. I can clear 3:12 without even trying. Get your 5 stacks and move onto the next camp. His early game is also insane. No one but trundle or Olaf is beating you 1v1 early. This makes an invade of your jungle highly unlikely. Darius is also about as good of a 1v2 champ as you can get. I have lost count of the amount of double kills I've gotten with through the years. \n\n\n\nHowever he's still Darius and still has all the same issues as he does in top lane. He has terrible mobility and he gets kited easily. His ganks are weak. He also falls off late game. If your teammates feed and the enemy jungler gets ahead of you then you're next to useless. By that I mean with someone like ammumu you're still a threat even when behind due to your engage, ultimate and tankiness. With Darius if you're not getting kills then that's it you're done.",

    "The best part of him being on the team would be we wouldn't have to play against him anymore. Feels like he kills us everytime he plays us",
    "My head cannon is that she doesn't know how to turn it on. I actually like the idea that she doesn't know how to use her atlas gauntlets like that and she just kind of just puts them on starts hitting things.",
    "It's like playing chess. There's a lot of thinking and decision making behind it. That's why I love it so much though",
    "This is the answer. I had the exact same issue and once those were changed out the truck ran perfect",
    "Nah bro it was way harder. I was a good kid in a bad situation and since I was kid I had no way out. Now I'm an adult and I never have to worry about that ever again",
    "Yes the bills don't stop, but at least I can go to work and do a job that's tolerable while I figure things out my way as opposed to being made to sit down and learn about useless subjects for hours and be at the mercy of adults.",

    "I would regret not using that green gecko, orange lizard with wings and that fighting fire monkey",
    "Getting him to use his teleport for a gank is still an ok result imo. Obviously teleport is very powerful and it their team loses a lot of map pressure and now they can't get back to lane fast enough and will lose a wave and a plate",

    "The game isn't decided by the best player. It's decided by the worst player",
    "Man the Kings being good is so good for the soul of this city. It's like there's a different vibe to the city. You start seeing kings gear at places other than the games again. We need that vibe back",
    "Mike Brown was really giving this guy DNPs",
    "Yi has a weak early game to make up for his strong late game. Don't go for ganks unless it is a guaranteed kill. and be selfish. Make sure you get the kill, not the assist. Farm. Farm. Farm. Farm. Farm. Buy items until you get to the 1v9 status. Don't fight other junglers in the early game, they'll kill you.",
    "Yeah when he used kamui to suck in naruto's Rasengan as naruto was moving through obito I was like damn this guy took his game to a whole new level",
    "I remember a few years ago this sub split into 2 because the mods were inactive or insulting it's members. They created a new sub and r/nba was clowning us saying this is a perfect representation of the disfunction how the actual franchise is being run.",
    "This is why viewship is down",
    "No matter what happened in the past it's never too late to build something new",

    "Nah the Kings were always \"win now\" they were just terrible at it. Now they've just gone from terrible to mediocre in that facet.",
    "The ending literally left me speechless with my jaw dropped",
    "Same. I see things in terms of gold now. Last night I lost dragon but our team got 3 kills in 3v2. They traded dragon for 900 gold and i got to steal their camps for another few hundred. I won that one",

    "I don't think Viktor is necessarily changing sides per se. He always wanted to help people, but his way of going about it is basically turning people to machines with no free will. In the end everyone is fighting because they do not believe in his philosophy.\n\n\nThe Black Rose is a faction that, in summary, uses magic to influence politics. Basically they are after ambessa and ambessa is looking for a weapon that can help fight them. \n\n\nWhat does anyone really want? This gets muddied between the seasons as it went from a very grounded plot of 2 sisters and 2 scientists into a save the world type story, but basically by the end of the story they're fighting to not get killed.",

    "Vs team 7 at the beginning of shippuden",
    "Length: Obviously, that's how long the rod is. Here's why it matters. For certain techniques you want a shorter rod and for some you want a longer rod. The longer the rod, the longer the cast. Of course you don't always need to make super long cast. For bass fishing all my cast are usually less than 20 yards. Shorter rods excel for techniques where you have to put a lot of action into the rod ie; a jerkbait. If you use a long rod for a jerk bait you will be hitting the side of the boat, ect. Longer rods excel for techniques like the a rig and big swimbaits since it allows more casting distance. \n\n\n\nPower: med-light, medium, med-heavy, heavy. It's how much pressure it takes to bend the rod. Why it matters is if you are throwing a light lure you want to use a lower power so you can cast further and more accurate. Power also helps with hook setting Power. You don't always want the most hook setting Power possible. Treble hook lures you don't need to set the hook hard since it's usually a lighter wire hook and it's exposed so it's possible that if you set the hook too hard then you will either rip the hook out of its mouth or you will make a hole so big the fish can easily throw the hook. For something with a thick hook like a frog you want more hook setting power\n\n\nAction: moderate, moderate-fast, fast, extra fast. This is how far the rod will bend. Fast is the top 20% and moderate is more like the top 50%. This matters because for some lures you want a more moderate, or parabolic bend. The more moderate the rod, the more the rod will absorb the shock of the fish. This allows you to keep fish on the hook when they jump and it allows you to play with them a bit more. The faster the action also usually means you feel the bite faster, not necessarily better, but faster. But of course, you don't always want to feel the bite faster. Something like a jig you want to give the fish a second before setting the hook. \n\n\nImportant to understand that these are not completely universal and it varies from brand to brand. Some brand's fast will be another brand's extra fast ect.\n\n\nAnd the lure is just a guideline and is usually pretty helpful and accurate, but it is not the end all be all. I personally would not use a rod that short for frogs. The shortest I would go is 7 ft heavy-fast for open water frigging and 7'3 heavy-fast for frigging on top of mats. Everyone has their preferences and you will find your own through time.",
    "Jinx's tea party",
    "Im hoping that they give us a date or time frame soon. I need some more content to look forward to again. I waited 3 years for season 2 and no that there's no more to wait for it feels weird",
    "Season 1 episode 9 and season 2 episode 7 for me",
    "I believe that was the point. Before he disappeared he said he'd be back in a wink. He doing this for Ekko was his redemption. He believed in his student",

    "Kings are 1-0 in the Jae Crowder era",
    "Yes, i strongly disliked how the show went from what was a very grounded story of 2 sisters, 2 scientists, and 2 cities into what it was. Still the best thing i have ever watched, but I disliked the direction it went in the end.",
    "No Fox, Sabonis, Monk, or DeRozan in right now. What do you even do? Lol",
    "Higher chance of missing",
    "Nah it was beating the warriors in the play ins",

    "Yes I know it was a nice dunk by Malik, but should've put it in soft there",
    "I will never take Domas for granted",
    "Draper has improved and is at least somewhat tolerable most of the time now. Katie is God awful terrible. I've been a big fan of her since the house party live days, but when she is just so bad as an announcer. I lost it last year when she blamed the teams poor performance saying that it was because they had to hang out with the fans at raleys and Bel air for an event the day before.",
    "God I remember the super analytical fans they brought in to make a suggestion came up with rge idea that of Marcus Smart wasn't available then we should trade the pick. It's halirious in hindsight because that was the better call than the one actually made by the actual team",
    "Beno in the draino. The Tasmanian Slovenian. Love Beno. Solid player that got caught up in some really bad teams",

    "Just do what I do. Ignore it for a few weeks and you'll eventually stop caring about it",
    "I left Sac State 8 years ago and I'll tell you this from my experience. College is not the last place you will meet new people and make new friends, BUT it is the last EASY place you can meet new people and make new friends. Right now is a golden opportunity for this. Most people around you are around your general age group, are all pursuing the same goal, and likely have similar interests. Heck, you have clubs that are specifically formed around a very specific interest. Put your self out there and join every club or study group you can. Back then I didn't have the confidence to enjoy myself they way i should have, but don't let that stop you from going out there and meeting new people.",

    "Chidori is nature transformation. Sasuke and Kakashi use their lightning release Chakra nature to create the chidori in the palm of their hand.\n\nRaikiri takes it one step further and not only does he do the nature transformation adds shape manipulation into it. This shape manipulation changes the shape of the chidori into a pointed spear type shape.",
    "Yes that's the joke, but at the same time OP is also calling bull shit on that post",

    "Eye test says different. He straight up won the Kings a couple games this year like against Minnesota, the lakers, and Portland",
    "If you're new and want to keep it simple. Just stick to 8 pound mono. It's cheap and a good beater line. I've used this for years when I've started and it was never an issue. I've always used Berkeley trilene for mono.\n\n\n\nIf you're more serious I use the following:\n\nFor braid is like suffix 832, but powerpro is really good to.  For fluorocarbon I like sunline sniper or segaur red label.\n\nFor frogs: 55 pound straight braid \n\nFor soft texas rig, wacky rig, qrolina rig: 20 pound braid to 16 pound fluorocarbon. \n\nFor drop shot or Ned rig: 20 pound braid to 10 pound fluorocarbon \n\nFor crankbaits: 20 pound braid to 16 pound fluorocarbon \n\nFor jerk baits: 20 pound braid to 12 pound fluorocarbon \n\nFor topwater poppers, propbaits, buzzbaits, and walking baits: 20 pound braid to 12 pound monofilament \n\nFor spinnerbaits or chatterbaits: 20 pound braid to 16 pound fluorocarbon",

    "Well gotta start with the 3 all Stars and the only 3 who made an all-nba team.\n\n1) Fox\n2) Sabonis\n3) Cousins - while I feel he is the most talented of the 3 we simply didn't win with him here and I understand that wasn't completely his fault but still we didn't accomplish a single thing as a team. \n\n4) Rudy Gay\n5) Malik Monk",

Like hey I can't hurt this demon because his skin is too tough so I'll just shoot him when he opens his mouth. Or hey this guy is too fast I can't hit him with my spirit gun so I'll have to hit him with a sneak attack from behind. Those felt earned.",
