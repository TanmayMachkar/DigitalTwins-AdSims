    "All in all, it\u2019s just another tennis ball in the court\u2026",
    "If you\u2019re a fan of songs with long instrumentals, then Yes is for you as well; Roundabout is good, but they made more hits than just that",
    "Arabia Fats. You know, the guy with the Sun.",
    "Yeah Book the Pink and Purple goes hard\n\nThen again, so does Marker the Green\u2026",

    "So your stand, Star Platinum, is the same as my stand, The World.",
    "True. All I care about is that I don\u2019t see the faces",
    "Remember how in the deleted scene from BFDI 7, where Announcer Speaker Box had Woody rejoin the winning team?\n\nWell, I imagine Flower Speaker Box, by some means, would become the new host (would make sense bc she didn\u2019t appear in BFDIA yet), revive Woody, and let him join BFDIA out of pity because he was considered in another timeline, but not in this one, to rejoin the previous season.\n\nSince it\u2019s so close to the end of the season, and FSB is just as nice as Flower (as in not at all), this isn\u2019t likely to happen, but iT\u2019s JuSt A tHeOrY",
    "Yeah, real glad he\u2019s getting the screen time he so deserves",
    "Sure",
    "Create a new season that surely he\u2019d win in:\n\nBattle for Coiny Dream Island (BFCDI)\n\nContestants: Coiny, Nickel (should be easy for Coiny to win, especially that early on in the series)\n\nPrize: Uhhh\u2026a coin-based island?",
    "Oh, didn\u2019t know that. Cool!",
    "You\u2019re right. At least they\u2019re out of the OSC\u2026",
    "Alright bet\n\n*upvotes*",

    "Bryce Pinkham",
    "They always seem to get some of the most out-of-place voice actors (him, Richard Steven Horvitz, etc.) musical numbers, and they\u2019re somehow able to sing them well!",
    "Snowball and Grassy, it\u2019s a duo that somehow works",
    "A man of zippers, or even a Zipper Man?",
    "She shines out more in BFDIA than any other season, and I like that, even if she becomes a total villain\n\nBut BFDIA 19, her insulting everyone for fun feels way too out of character",
    "I would say that the op should be honest about what they like, but in this situation\u2026",
    "I bet you\u2019d be correct for the first song: they\u2019ll probably keep the continuity with another Yes song\n\nYes is so peak, they do long instrumentals so well",
    "We just have to be grateful for what we have: 27 episodes, a pilot, a Netflix original movie, a group of comics, a dedicated fan base, and Richard Steven Horvitz continuing to be as crazy  of a va as ever",
    "Nor did they say why there\u2019s an issue with the voting system.",
    "Only because it\u2019s different from the norm",

    "Real unfortunate that show got cancelled, there isn\u2019t anything quite like it",
    "Can you guess what the stand does?",
    "No, the voting system we have is fine. As Cary showed on his channel, the votes are valid. You just need to cope with the results, and believe me, we all have to as well.",
    "Thanks, now Bloody Stream is stuck in my head again",
    "Tb isn\u2019t a bad character, but Fries should\u2019ve stayed. Not gonna join tho, sorry",
    "True. 4b focused more on individual characters and gave development for most of its characters, something 4a could only do in 20+ minute episodes and 2-parters.",
    "Japanese arc\n\nParts 4 and 5 are such a vibe",
    "\u201cI AM INVADER ZIM!\u201d\n\nWhoops, same voice actor, wrong character",

    "Those lyrics go hard af",
    "Don\u2019t cry! Come on, you target for faraway laughter! Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!\n\nRecalling these lyrics made me realize how close this song relates to Josuke, deeper than just a name",
    "Warm Body, Cold Touch",
    "I don\u2019t know, but I hope sbr brings this show mainstream again",
    "That guy should really be asking where their heart went",
    "Book deserves it after all she\u2019s gone through\n\nIf not her then Needle, they were the only two contestants that didn\u2019t go insane last episode imo",
    "Fair",

    "Not seeing Spike Spiegel or Ichigo Kurosaki on that picture is vile\n\n\n\nOh yeah no Jotaro on there is bad too",
    "Snowball had a MASSIVE turnaround in TPOT, going from another uninteresting bully to a strong leader, who somehow made friends with Grassy",
    "Yeah Coiny\u2019s the one that did it first anyways",
    "Nobody: \n\nKhnum",
    "But anytime you want to use it, you\u2019ll have to sit through the whole 23-minute song first\n\nWait that isn\u2019t a bad consequence Pink Floyd is peak-",
    "Except Polnareff (the animation studio) eventually becomes a large but cruel corporation like Disney",
    "Btw I voted for Leafy to be the host. It\u2019d be interesting to see her giving extra points for\u2026everybody, so she doesn\u2019t lose a potential friend.",
    "Pretty good, but I felt like almost everyone was out of character: Pin went from just taking advantage of people to win to being a total jerk to everybody. Coiny\u2019s acting like nothing happened (but I bet he\u2019ll break down next episode). I don\u2019t think Tennis Ball would usually be swayed that easily to kill (and revive) his friends for a challenge. But Book and Needle were still Book and Needle, and everyone else was still everyone else.\n\nFries getting eliminated shocked me, but I think it had to do with Gelatin and Firey giving TB immunity for making the slide. They should\u2019ve made it more obvious that it was rigged.\n\nOtherwise, the Cake at Stake theme was epic (my favorite so far), the challenge and host were unique, Leafy was interesting (I feel that it was in character for her to be that crazy, she\u2019s desperate for a friend), and overall it\u2019s a pretty good episode. Not my favorite, but it\u2019s different from anything we\u2019ve seen before, and I love that about BFDIA: nothing stays the same. The teams, the setting, the host, nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that part 2 is coming out this month, I\u2019m excited! (I bet they\u2019ll have to set up shops for next episode in order to \u201cdistribute\u201d their \u201cthings\u201d. Interesting.)",
    "But they count them as Winner and Loser, as they mention their interactions during BFDI sometimes, so yeah they should count",
    "I don\u2019t know; if they don\u2019t exist, then did they really appear in BFDI(A)? I feel like they\u2019d pull out the \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist\u201d excuse like they did in TPOT if they do get the most votes",
    "I heard that bots caused Tennis Ball to have the most likes and dislikes in last episode- maybe they didn\u2019t include those votes in this episode? Either way, I\u2019ll be equally sad- TB and Fries are both one of my favorite characters in this season",
    "Take the Long Way Home (following the pattern from BFDIA 18 and naming it after a Supertramp song)\n\nThis could be a metaphor about Pin looking towards redemption after the last episode, or maybe Leafy would return and try to get on good terms with Firey. Or it could just simply be about the crew finding their way back to Southern Goiky, where the season first began. Either way the title would fit well if any of these things happen, but I bet it\u2019s too old a song for them to reference (it\u2019s a late 70s song btw)",

    "I think it\u2019s an old 2007 ova of Phantom Blood, but I heard it\u2019s lost media, and wasn\u2019t released or something like that\n\nI wonder where this person got those pictures from if that\u2019s the case",
    "Gunpowder, gelatine\n\nWait wrong subreddit",
    "I think the best thing about this post is that they\u2019re on light mode\n\n(My phone changes with the day btw)",
    "True, it\u2019s probably one of the weakest episodes in TPOT. Tame challenge, weak interactions (besides the Death Pact Again stuff), and it just so happened to be followed by two of (arguably) the best episodes in the season",
