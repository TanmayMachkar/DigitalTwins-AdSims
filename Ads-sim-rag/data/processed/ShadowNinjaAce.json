    "What is YC3?",
    "What isekai shota anime are we talking about here?",
    "It was that fucking draconic tree sentinel before Maliketh. I swear I died like 50-60 times and managed to get Maliketh under 20 tries",
    "You did me dirty man \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude23",
    "Made King Kobra a skewer",

    "Its a rainy day",
    "Dan Da Dan IYKYK",
    "For a second I thought the world was healing assuming its 652 per month \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Tbf I dont think Lulushia was targeted because Sabo was there. Imu did say its because it was nearby (and probably because it was one of the 8 nations that successfully rebelled the WG. Sabo surviving that was luck",
    "Yeah, and a little bit of Greed?",
    "Oh I see. Thanks for the explanation",
    "That kinda sucks. Is there a reason MSc and Phd are preferred over MEng for TAs?",
    "Thanks. I will be sure to ask them",
    "Yes, he is \u2026\n\n![gif](giphy|rUgkjoRgwo3wWMceFa)",
    "Solved",
    "This is the one. Thank you \ud83e\udd79",
    "Not this too",
    "https://voca.ro/1aVKHRBWb9tT",
    "Not this either. I will send the vocaroo",
    "Not Golden Hour",
    "Thank you and I hope you can find it for me \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Where do you find these changes?",
    "I loved the change. Hated that bob cut\u2019s attitude",
    "I loved the change. Hated that bob cut\u2019s attitude",
    "I hate both",
    "Of all people Nami???",
    "Dont give a reason for someone\u2019s love\n\n-Corazon",
    "I see you have refined taste for a mortal",
    "Worst show? Naaaah. That\u2019s reserved and only for Rent A Girlfriend",
    "One more reason to hate that pos now. Thanks for the info",
    "Wait what?! He asks us to make Ranni a doll too, not just Nephli?!?!",
    "Same here. Its a daily occurrence",
    "Whats this in your inventory?",
    "Oh cool cool",
    "Make sense. I remember the clone giving us this menacing look and not Frieren herself",
    "Its the random compliments that keep me going",
    "It\u2019s draining as a duo too",
    "Which episode was this frame from?",
    "Dont give a fuck. If I have to solo heal (Mind you I wanted to test out a Vanguard or Duelist but still decided to choose Strategist because 3 of you decided to go Duelist) Im leaving. Y\u2019all can play your crazy game",
    "Who is Paul?",
    "![gif](giphy|LGo31ZR7kCQOA)",
    "Maplestar and Cloverworks colab for the last episode",
    "I think more people love him than hate him",
    "No I was just curious what aspect you were thinking of. But yeah not trying to bring down your opinion",
    "What part of his character is fan service?",
    "Usopp",
    "Time to leave this sub \ud83d\udc4b",
    "Why is this so relatable \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d.",
    "Ive started to trust lords less and less. This isnt a dig at those who are genuine beasts at their character. But when I see a lord play like concrete lll over and over, I start to question the legitimacy of that lord title",
    "Thanks",
    "What is LOS",
    "Can we petition to get rid of this? i dont want to go down to gold. I just hit Diamond 3",
    "Which anime is this from? I cant seem to recall it",
    "Happened to me and my duo at Plat 2 \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Stuck in Plat too. I mainly use C&D and Loki sometimes too. Ive been wanting to try Mantis and Warlock more. But personally I think C&D has a pretty decent mass heal. If you use Daggers Veil correctly you can constantly heal 3-4 players at the same time which makes a huge difference when its a massive showdown, and being able to use your bubble correctly will make tanks life much easier up front. \n\nEdit: and I would say C&D is a pretty easy character master if you are willing to switch try them out",
    "Cant even play offline ffs \ud83d\ude2d",
    "It\u2019s shocking how inflexible some are and stubborn enough to not change things up when it\u2019s not going well. Its not quick play where you can test a character out and not have a consequence. But even in quick play I dont like to over play a character thats not working.",
    "Yeah thats a common occurrence too. One person threw the game because another person politely asked them to try a different strategist and even offered to switch, but no, he decided to hang around spawn",
    "Thanks for that. I will try using that to improve my numbers",
    "Yeah I just did the same. Some of them average 26k which is pretty insane. But I thought comparing against the best of the game wasn\u2019t a great gauge for someone like me who is still climbing up the ranks. So I was trying to see what an acceptable average is in general",
    "Ive seen her around a lot but which anime is she from?",
    "Hardboiled",
    "Love love love song - Chillin in another world with Level 2 cheat skills",
    "Just checked the inventory and I have another Nagakiba. So I might have picked it up when I fought Elanora. I guess its fine. Thank you",
    "Not the whole way. I activated the site of grace before the lift, where we fight the Gargoyle with Milicent as a summon",
    "Didnt go all the way. Just beat the Gargoyle before the lift to the mountain tops. But looks like that was more than enough",
    "Vanguard: (1. Peni Parker, 2. Venom)\nDuelist: (1. Star Lord, 2. Psylocke 3. Iron Man)\nStrategist: (1. Cloak & Dagger, 2. Loki, 3. Jeff)",
    "Oh I didnt know. Thanks for that. Thought my game broke \ud83d\ude05",
    "My Mimic and I",
    "He has no enemies",
    "Regarding Blaidd, >!I thought he betrayed Ranni, and was watching over her because he was ordered to by the Two Fingers. Thats why Iji imprisoned him in the Goal. !<",
    "Who is the one on the left",
    "Can someone explain 3 to me.\n\n>!3 only has one inlet and one outlet. From 3 liquid goes down to the tank between 3 and 9. But that pipe connects to the tank on the left (between 2 and 8). There is no outlet here hence filling up the last tank, and finally 3!<",
    "Love?",
    "This BP doesn\u2019t kill",
    "I did LMAO \ud83d\ude02",
    "Thats not me :(",
    "Im trying him out at 230 Horizontal and 125 Vertical sensitivity. How high is yours?",
    "WTF",
    "Whats the ending?",
    "What speech?",
    "Why buy a skin if you can be Loki",
    "Cool I will try that",
    "Cool. Is there anything that might be affected if I rebuild the database?",
    "Thanks. I will check that out",
    "10 Kaguyas \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f",
    "Thanks for that insight. I wasn\u2019t thinking of her as a potential love interest to be honest, just thought she could have sticked around a bit more as a supporting character. Your points make a lot of sense.",
    "Yeah 4-3-3 Attack is a CAM and two CMs\n\nOh I see. So I guess I will have to find a different formation and a CDM",
    "16 iirc",
    "What is EOS?",
    "I see an imposter",
    "She doesn\u2019t need fixing \ud83d\ude07",
    "Are you one of my people?",
    "Did you figure it out? Im kind of stuck in the same thing. All coaches besides my defence coach seem to be improving in Gegenpressing\n\nEdit: My issue is in FC 24 though",
    "Same here. Stopped playing after a game went so bad I was basically just a squishy for the enemy team. None of my hits registered at all lol",
    "I should do the same as well. Thanks",
    "Bit late to the thread, but how do you get them to that level?",
    "I see. Thanks for that clarification",
    "Still hate her for that\n\n![gif](giphy|dtIGTEaGLRvdODtdQe|downsized)",
    "Right? its only 64 eps",
    "Wait what paralyzed woman?",
    "Bait post. Cant take this seriously. JJK carried by animation? LOL",

    "Weakness disgusts me",
    "Take this crown \ud83d\udc51",
    "Miyazaki killing it with the JoJo\u2019s pose",
    "She has a great personality",
    "Elsa Granheirt",
    "Sauce for the top picture",
    "Was that supposed to be an insult?",
    "What is wrong with driving on the left lane?",
    "It wont be imaginary though \ud83d\ude09",
    "We gonna let her cook \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
    "I don\u2019t remember it ever being a good thing",
    "I dont know about him being contradictory but doesn\u2019t \u201cI dont feel a thing\u201d still make sense as it portraying his personality?",
    "Damn. So its the \u201cYou are either with us or against us\u201d kinda thing",
    "Yeah it didnt feel like the right choice. Thanks for the info. Gonna continue finishing the dungeon instead",
    "Whats funny is I thought you were joking lmao",
    "Thanks for the info",
    "Godskin Noble",
    "Cool. Thanks for the info",
    "Cool. Thanks for the info. I still have a lot of improving to do",
    "Does it drain stamina by percentage? So regardless of how much I increase stamina it will take the same proportion?",
    "Thanks for the info. I managed to get the other two early on during a few encounters so I assumed it was the normal drop rate.",
    "Thank you",
    "Thank you",
    "Those two getting married at the end of the series",
    "Thats the neat part, you dont",
    "She might be a good president. She just had poor taste in men",
    "Sasuga Ainz Sama",
    "Its sex but better",
    "I just want to give Shuna hugs and headpats",
    "Thanks for that explanation. What you said makes sense. I guess it would have been more clear if we had like a small panel that showed how much it might have meant for him during the second double dungeon.",
    "Yeah. I do like the ship, but the story, imo would have just done fine without their romance.",
    "He would have went either way. He would have had to deal with the monsters from the gate before his family gets hurt. Not tackling the gate has no merit since he is literally the only one who can do it.",
    "But that's the thing, even after all their previous interactions, even after she blatantly admitted it, he never showed interest in her or thought about her all that time.",

    "I haven't finished the game yet. Does this mean it will be a new side quest/ending or it will change something in the story",
    "Im still in act 2 though",
    "Yeah it was glitched. Thanks",
    "Actually it might have been a glitch. I just retried it and there is a counter now showing how many turns till halsin is back",
    "Oh that sucks. Are you able to choose whether or not it can activate?",
    "Oh ok \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
    "Thats reassuring. Hopefully I see it again",
    "Cool cool. I dont recall if I did that",
    "Oh ok. Did you intimidate her to let the cub go with you?",
    "Wait there is more? What more to know?",
    "Oh I see. I guess thats all the more reason to check out the LN. Thanks",
    "I see. Thanks",
    "Not even hell is enough, for what you did to March",

    "Is that a reference to some anime?",
    "The first 10 episodes and the last 2 episodes were polar opposites. I wasn't ready for this when I watched it.",
    "Tried it. No change",
    "Happy Cake day ig",
    "Honestly, give the 3-episode rule a try here too. I'm happy with how these 4 episodes have turned out so far.",
    "Yeah, that can be disappointing. But hopefully it keeps living up to our current expectations.",
    "There are great reboots, so hopefully, this becomes one of them.",
    "Thanks for the sum up. I can understand category 2's pov and their disappointment for not getting a FMAB-esque adaptation. Hopefully, Stampede turns out good enough cose so far it's been a great show for me. Also I just hope people come to terms with CGI. its come a long way from the early days.",
    "Which anime?",
    "Ah I see. Thank you",
    "Can someone kindly explain self insert?",
    "Wouldn't mind supporting that weight for her"
