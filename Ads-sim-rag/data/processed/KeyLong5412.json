    "Honestly, I kind of have to respectfully disagree. Aside from the leveling aspect, which I do agree with, leveling is basically non-existent and does a horrible job world building/teaching you how to play your class. Aside from that though, I think trying to say that today\u2019s wow is dumbed down compared to vanilla/TBC/Wrath feels a little off. Aside from talent trees (which, I\u2019d say in retail now is closer to the complexity of vanilla etc), the classes are, imo, quite a bit harder to play than early wow. Raid mechanics are SIGNIFICANTLY harder than anything, really pre wrath. Dungeons are more than just \u201cthis guy hits really hard\u201d. I would say that wow is definitely more casual friendly, but its top end content far exceeds anything that vanilla-cata had in terms of complexity and challenge. I\u2019m not sure how you could hop on to, say, a fire mage in retail and say that it is dumbed down compared to old mages where you almost exclusively spam frostbolt. \n\nIf anything, I\u2019d say wow has done a much better job at broadening its ability to cater to almost all demographics. You have very casual content with transmog, mount collection, achievement hunting, to casual solo content with world quests and delves to challenging solo content with high end delves that you definitely need to know your class to complete. You have casual small group content with mythic 0\u2019s and low keys, to incredibly challenging small group content with high m+ keys. There\u2019s large group scaling difficulty challenges with normal/heroic raid, and very difficult large group content in mythic raiding. I think that wow has really done a decent job at actually broadening its approach to all levels of gameplay. \n\nThere was absolutely a window in wow with, I\u2019d argue, cata-shadowlands where they were absolutely dumbing it down pretty hard, but since the start of dragonflight, I personally feel that they\u2019ve done a good job and bringing back some of the complexity to the game and classes. But this is all a personal opinion.",

    "Okay, that makes sense! Thanks for clearing that up. My response then is definitely DH as others have said. They have really good self sustain, really good mobility, and really good damage, in both tank and dps spec",
    "I would like to understand your purpose? Because based on your edit, you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t do Druid because you have one maxed? World quests don\u2019t end when you hit max level, they are, technically, a bridge to end game content. Are you, perchance, meaning just questing in general? Because you can still use your max Druid for doing world quests.",

    "He didn\u2019t? He *tried* to put a pause on allowing future leases for drilling on federal land(note that I put asterisks there because it was blocked by the courts and he abided by the block), but he didn\u2019t stop domestic oil production in the United States. Actually, the number of domestic oil drilling permits administered during the Biden administration went up.\n\nYou understand how supply and demand work, correct? During the height of the pandemic (during Biden\u2019s administration), the demand for oil dropped drastically due to a majority of the world halting almost all travel. Then, economies opened, people started traveling, and bam, demand rose rapidly, therefore causing an increase on global oil prices.",
    "You realize that covid didn\u2019t happen in the US until early 2020 and Biden is the president that actually handled a majority of COVID, or really, Trumps mismanagement of the initial breakout. Right? So you\u2019re giving trump a pass on his economy due to COVID only affecting the literal last year of his 4 year presidency? Yet Biden, who dealt with COVID for almost half of his presidency doesn\u2019t get a pass?",

    "That\u2019s a good question, that I don\u2019t know the answer to. Honestly, I\u2019m really bad at using the inspect feature, but I\u2019ll be on the lookout the next time I grab the mimic\u2019s tooth to see if that changes with it.",
    "A tip that I have learned is that, unless you have the mimic\u2019s tooth or whatever the relic is that makes them harder to detect, you can tell which chests are mimics based on how they look! The first, and easiest method is, when they enter your line of site, you\u2019ll usually see the chest open slightly and you\u2019ll see the teeth and mouth of the mimic. I haven\u2019t been able to validate whether leaving the room and coming back forces them to do it again, if it\u2019s a timed thing, or if they only do it once. \n\nThe second and most consistent method is based on the key latch. As you can tell from the bottom chest and the normal chest, their key latch is higher than the other two. That is a telltale sign that they\u2019re mimics! \n\nAgain, this specifically works as long as you don\u2019t have the mimic\u2019s tooth relic. If you have that, that makes it harder to detect them. I hope this helps!",
    "Holy shit. I watched this movie back when it came out, back when Netflix was the OG mailed DvD\u2019s and absolutely loved it. Since then, I could not for the life of me remember its name.

    "Yeah, I go several runs not even making it out of the sewers and then I hit some run that sends me to 10+, so there\u2019s definitely some lack of experience in the later levels. I know one of my main issues is that I get in to trading blows with mobs that I probably shouldn\u2019t be. I need to be better about disengaging, kiting, and surprise attacking. I appreciate the tips! I\u2019ll keep working at it and learning!",
    "I know something I need to understand a little better is better utilization of my SoU\u2019s. I need to better figure out when to swap from weapon upgrades to armor/trinkets and stuff. I tend to neglect armor, and it is sounding like I really shouldn\u2019t be neglecting that with upgrades. I appreciate your tips, and all the others on this post so far!",
    "I hope so! This was posted more tongue in cheek because I see a decent amount of people posting in here \u201cfor my first win after 25 runs!\u201d And I\u2019m over here pushing 100 lol. But I love the game nonetheless, I\u2019ll get there!",
    "I definitely take more risks than is necessary. I think I, too often, get in to trading blows with a mob that I could disengage and get some surprise attacks on. I know i really need to learn more about the alchemy and seeds, I don\u2019t really use seeds at all, and I use the basics of alchemy. I have faith, though, I think I am starting to figure more of it out and am on the brink. Thank you for the suggestions!",
    "I think that the last entire Sukuna fight is gonna be peak anime once it gets animated. It was some of the most badass, anticipated chapter releases I\u2019ve experienced.

I played OG vanilla, but I was 10, so didn\u2019t make it very far, and then I played the 2019 release, but only made it to 24 before quitting. All that to say, I do not even kind of know the paths in those later dungeons. When I get in a group, I just tell everyone \u201chey, these dungeons are mazes and I don\u2019t actually know where to go, so please stop me if I\u2019m going the wrong way\u201d. It doesn\u2019t take long before one of the other members takes over and walks just a bit ahead of me and I just follow their lead. In my experiences, if you over pull or head in a wrong direction, most people just say \u201chey, this way\u201d and I switch directions. So I understand being worried, and you will at some point meet a shitter that rages on you, but by in large, most of the people I\u2019ve encountered have been super chill and willing to help, just let them know in the beginning.",

So for someone that cares about the community interactions, it will detract from game play.

What\u2019s the fun in playing a team game but having to mute your teammates? It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s a one off thing, but it is a consistent issue that has plagued LoL since its conception. You may be okay with that, but there are going to be a lot of people that aren\u2019t.",

    "My wife and I have been together for 4, married for 2. Relatively early on, I\u2019d say somewhere nearing a year, she had some friends that snooped on me, because, protective friends I suppose, and found I had followed some women on instagram that did risky cosplay, or had OF\u2019s. She confronted me, in a matter of fact, but not accusatory manner. I told her that I followed them when I was young, and I don\u2019t use instagram. Hadn\u2019t posted on it in, like, 5 years, and only opened it when she sent me things. She trusted me that the reasoning was true, but asked me to unfollow them for her own self assurance and security, I said \u201cYou got it, but please give me some grace here because there are 700+ people I follow and I\u2019m bound to miss some\u201d. So I did that, naturally missed some, and she brought them to my attention and I unfollowed them. If they aren\u2019t being nefarious, they\u2019ll comply. If they are, ESPECIALLY if they\u2019re making you feel bad because THEY aren\u2019t providing you security, then get out. Immediately. NOR",

So my stats aren\u2019t even super optimized, but I\u2019m still able to pull about 11-14k burst and sustain between 7-9k on my ranger depending on the boss fight. So I just think there\u2019s possibly some sort of baseline thing that may be missed. Stats and IS alone should not provide you with 5k dps increases. Granted emblems could, but that\u2019s about it.",
    "Something that most people don\u2019t fully recognize in this game is; the rotation is absurdly important. You should make sure you understand what all of your skills/talents do for you. There could be a very simple fix in your dps. For instance, assuming you\u2019re specced correctly, you should only have hit your 1 if you can hit a second 1 consecutively. It gives a big damage buff that you need to keep 100% up time, but you only get the buff if you hit 1 twice in a row. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s your problem, I\u2019m just saying that, you need to make sure you understand the basics of the class before you beat yourself up with IS. \n\nI say this from experience, I didn\u2019t put the amount of work to understand my necro dps rotation for a while, and then one day, I learned that I was doing it incorrectly, so I practiced and fixed my rotation and went from about 3-4k dps to sustaining 6-9k dps. So really just make sure you understand the synergy of your abilities and talent points.\n\nEdit; I also forgot to add, check your hit rating. If you are below the hit cap, then it will massacre your dps.",
    "Bro, I saw you on your other post. This game does not cater to sweat lords. This game is, actually, incredibly casual friendly considering the fact that you only need to log in, for like, an hour a day to finish all your daily stuff, as well as if you miss a day, it will allow you to make up the rewards the following day. \n\nOn your other post and comments, you very clearly, don\u2019t want to participate in an MMO, and refuse to join a guild because some of them want to use discord? You don\u2019t have to commit to any sort of schedule at all, but you are, for some reason, committed to this idea that people that organize and play together are sweat lords?

In my time pugging, I have found some really bad groups that couldn\u2019t finish some content, and then I\u2019ve had other groups that facerolled the hardest content.

The worst part though, the first time I saw her get an allergic reaction, she was eating a turkey jerky stick. Turns out, a lot of turkey jerky uses beef casin (spelling?), we learned to read more closely after that. We still ate and drank dairy, she would generally just get some hives if she ate a lot of that. Crazy thing, when she was pregnant with our daughter, a little over a year ago, she was really craving a hamburger, and she wanted to risk it while we were on vacation because it can go away on its own sometimes. The allergy just went away, we aren\u2019t sure if it was the pregnancy, or if it had just ran its course, but now she is alpha gal free.",

Learn from them, or perpetuate ignorance. This conversation is very clearly a waste of time, and I really hope that if you have kids, or plan on having kids, you don\u2019t have a neurodivergent child that you correct with physical abuse that then goes on to hospitalize someone.",
    "It really doesn\u2019t take that much effort to find these studies man. \n\n[National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/does-child-abuse-cause-crime)\n\n[National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9590671/)\n\nLike, the studies are there. There is no 100% probability that if you\u2019re spanked as a kid, you\u2019re going to become a volatile adult, I for one, am not a volatile adult though I was hit as a kid. And it sounds like you were also in the boat. I\u2019m happy we both beat the statistic, but don\u2019t sit there and ignore the statistics because YOU\u2019RE on the benefiting end of them. \n\nThere is an absolute correlation between children that were neglected/abused that then go on to commit violent crimes. And it is entirely disingenuous and ignorant to say otherwise.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify, I am not against spanking a child, I was spanked, my brother was spanked, and my sister was spanked. My brother and I needed it, it worked very well on us. My sister on the other hand, it destroyed her, sent her in to a panic, took every ounce of reasoning out of her body and caused some emotional damage. So to say that had this person, with some prebuilt in emotional issues, been hit as a kid would have prevented this? I strongly disagree with, and would have exacerbated their already very fragile emotional strength. \n\nSpanking is a valid parenting tactic, but it is not right for every child and will, statistically, create some very emotionally and physically volatile adults.",
    "There are a lot of violent people in a lot of social situations. You\u2019re incredibly obtuse if you don\u2019t see that. Statistically speaking, children exposed to child abuse, are more prone to becoming more physically volatile. There is no opinion in that, there is no such thing as opinion in statistics. Even if the number is 51%, that is STILL greater than half, therefore STATISTICALLY more likely to occur. I am happy you are in the other 49%, as am I. But for you to say that abusing a child to prevent this sort of behavior, but not acknowledging the fact that it STATISTICALLY would lead to worse outcomes is just ignorant. \n\nI am not saying that this person was raised effectively, because absolutely not, BUT beating them as a kid would have made this person, obviously already very emotionally unstable, emotionally unstable with flying fists.",

    "Edit: I should have verified this before making this comment. Highmountain Tauren cannot be paladins. So for this question specifically, the only answer is Tauren. \n\nHonestly, nowadays, the race doesn\u2019t truly matter. They will both function perfectly fine, unless you intend to start working on the .1% of content. So at the end of the day, pick whichever race you find more aesthetically pleasing. \n\nAs far as racials go, Tauren receive a 1% (I\u2019m not actually sure about the number, so please don\u2019t quote me on that) stamina buff, so higher health pool. They also have an AoE stun with a very fast cast time, but a short range. So that can definitely be useful. \n\nHighmountain, if I\u2019m not mistaken, receive a 1% versatility buff, which is again, nice, but verse as far as I\u2019m aware, isn\u2019t the #1 stat for any of the specs. Even if it is, 1% is negligible to 99.9% of the community. They also have a stun, but it\u2019s in the form of a charge forward, stunning everything in their path. So again, useful, but by no means any sort of class defining feature. \n\nI, personally, prefer Tauren because I choose my races based more on transmog ability than racials and though the highmountain Tauren can have somewhat cool horns, they don\u2019t fit the aesthetic that I am going for in a paladin. Additionally, I prefer the stationary stun, over the directional stun, but that\u2019s a pure preference. \n\nTL;DR the class doesn\u2019t matter from a play style perspective, and you should choose your class based on what you think looks best/resonate with from a lore perspective/randomly, unless you intended to do the absolute top in, hard content.",

You don\u2019t replay it and think \u201cman, that was gruesome\u201d he took, just a normal hit, normal tackle, the RB wasn\u2019t even running full speed. I would argue that in comparison to most hits in the NFL, it was a light hit. And then he just stands up, sits still for a little while and goes down. I think that\u2019s one of the contributors to this instances being so horrifying. I replayed the hit like 7 times trying to see if there was something weird I didn\u2019t catch, but there wasn\u2019t, and that\u2019s what proved to me, this was absolutely just a freak accident. Then you look at everything else that occurred after the hit and it gets scarier",

    "I don\u2019t have the estimate I got from the center, but they had made it sound like it is an estimated flat cost of ~$6200. I think I understand what you\u2019re saying with, if the center ends up pricing it all out much more expensive, then with it being OON insurance won\u2019t cover near as much, and we would be responsible for the rest. But does that change any if they do end up only pricing the entire birth out to $6200?\n\nEdit: don\u2019t have the estimate right in front of me",
    "I don\u2019t have the cost estimate in front of me, but the centers estimated total cost through the pregnancy was ~$6200, with $1000 upfront, and the rest paid by 35 weeks. I don\u2019t know exactly how that works for the insurance side, I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019d have to pay the rest of the deductible, then the other $3000 would be billed to insurance once the deductible was met, but I don\u2019t know the exact timeline it would get billed. \n\nYes, prenatal care is with the same facility.",
    "Okay, I think I understand what you\u2019re saying. My understanding from what we talked to finance rep at the center was that, she has already met her in network for the year, $3000 and her OON is $6000, and she said that we would just have to pay the rest of the OON, but based on what you said, they would bill the OON after L&D, so therefore they would bill the insurance after the change of the year, therefore the deductible would reset and we would have to pay up to the $6000 OON deductible. Am I understanding that correctly?\n\nEdit: I feel I should clarify, the total cost without insurance for the center is $6200, so basically what I\u2019m understanding is we would more than likely, regardless of insurance, have to pay all of that based on deductible resets.",

Half the time she is egging him on to play vice the other way around!",
    "Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but for me personally, my (to be) wife will always take priority over our children. My fianc\u00e9 and I are getting married in 2 months, and I entered the relationship without children, and she has a 6 year old daughter (I entered when she was 4). I have always said that my fianc\u00e9 takes priority, but I say that for a couple of reasons. \n\n1) Her happiness is my priority, and our relationship is my priority. I know that one of her biggest impacts on her happiness is the wellbeing of her daughter and having a quality, loving, father since the blood father is very inconsistent and one foot in one foot out type of guy. So I am trying to be that father figure she wants for her daughter. \n\n2) I feel, as a father, it is my job to show our children what a loving, healthy relationship is. I need to teach her daughter how a person should treat their SO. Her biggest impression of how a relationship should be is the relationship of her parents. I can\u2019t control how her father\u2019s relationships go, but I can control how her mom\u2019s relationship is. I\u2019m not saying she has to do what we do, just that I want to show her that she shouldn\u2019t be with someone that mistreats her, or can\u2019t communicate with her, or doesn\u2019t foster their relationship.\n\nI have always wanted to be a father, and I love her daughter as if she were my own, and I won\u2019t ever make her feel like I don\u2019t, so I am not doing all of this to appease my fianc\u00e9 or because I feel obligated to. I have always had this thought regardless of if I was a step parent or not. I believe that if our relationship is as good as it can be, then it will make all of the other pieces fall together. It will allow us to handle the trials of parenting effectively because our relationship is healthy, and there won\u2019t be some unsaid resentment that adds on to the difficulties of parenting. \n\nAt the end of the day, you do you, but like many people have said on this post, an unhealthy relationship leads to divorce, which leads to limited time with the child you are prioritizing.",

    "Exactly, the other branches don\u2019t get their justice just because the term got coined as cuss like a sailor, but really, it\u2019s the entirety of the military.",
    "But, in my opinion, that\u2019s what separates someone from cussing a lot out of anger, and someone cussing like a sailor. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to constantly be creatively offending someone. Just that you don\u2019t cuss like a sailor if ALL you do is say fuck a lot.",
    "I\u2019m not going to give examples, because literally our intent was to push as much of a boundary as we could in offending someone using profanity. And I\u2019m not trying to get banned on Reddit.",
    "I don\u2019t know the validity of this, since this was one of the traditional type of things in the navy, where it\u2019s mostly just passed via word of mouth from seasoned sailors to junior sailors.\n\nBut basically I was told that, obviously the navy and sailing in the 1800\u2019s and earlier was a very, very dangerous endeavor, where people got hurt and killed often. So basically because of that, like most things that are hard, the bond you make under mutual suffering is very strong. So it became a brotherhood, and often you have to earn your right in to a brotherhood. And one of those ways to verify you were part of the brotherhood was by cursing, since back then, even using the word damn in the right contexts offended A LOT of people and went against some religious taboos. And that\u2019s what sailors did, they were a rough, offensive, crowd. So you needed to be offensive to be accepted.",
    "While I do understand what you\u2019re saying. My opinion of it is that just because you use a common curse word a lot, doesn\u2019t mean you cuss like a sailor. It\u2019s when your attaching human qualities, in a creative, often mean, way to said boiler. No sailor i know would blush to the word fuck a bunch, what really makes them blush is if you can get creative and make them say \u201cdamn, that was a good one\u201d",

How to be given a lot of information, in a short time frame, and teach you to learn, and pick out the important details since reactor technologies are changing all the time\u201d.

    "I just got a Great Dane puppy about 7 weeks ago now. I brought him in with my rescue that I got about 3 years ago when she was 1.5 years old, she is a mix of a bunch of dogs, but mostly German Shepard, husky, boxer, and Australian cattle dog. I was a little worried when I\u2019d introduce them because she is very docile, pretty protective of my fianc\u00e9 and and my soon to be 6 year old step child (I only specify that to convey that my rescue hadn\u2019t been with the child since I brought her home). She is touchy with her hips, has evidence of abuse, overall, I was just a little worried how she would adjust to a rambunctious puppy, that would rapidly out size her. \n\nLong story short, they play and get along wonderfully, he is now her size, if not a little bigger than she is, but when they played, I let the older dog (her name is kora) teach Finley (the Dane) her boundaries, supervised of course. If I felt their play was getting a little energetic, and one of them was getting overwhelmed, I would usually separate Finley from her with a toy, and let her catch her breath a little bit. \n\nI think the best way to teach a dog how to interact with a dog, and learn their boundaries, is to let them interact and teach each other. Pay attention to their body language, if it looks like the smaller dog is getting defensive and overwhelmed, separate them. And obviously, obedience train them. Need to be able to control both dogs when tempers start getting flared or adrenaline and instinct start to kind of take over.",
