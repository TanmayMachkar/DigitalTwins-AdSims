    "Sad to see, I used them to buy a few board games and accessories a few times and everything has been great. Didn't even know the expanded into Pokemon. Shame to seem them doing this stuff. Good for calling them out.",
    "Personally I think the jump between primary to secondary is too big for a lot of kids to cope with. Saw close friends growing up that did a complete 180 from playing every day after school and being a fun kid to just being a shut in and cutting contact no matter how much we tried to not let it happen once starting secondary. \n\nWe probably should copy the Americans and have some kind of middle school for the middle years. I'm not sure how you'd do it maybe years 6/7/8 in the middle and 9/10/11 for secondary?\n\nAlso the workload expected of kids doesn't help. You go from maybe 1 or 2 homework pieces a week at primary to 6 or 7 a week at secondary.",
    "It's getting worse and worse. I walk past a greggs every morning and I've witnessed someone run in grab a load of food and run on 3 different mornings this year already. The Asda I usually shop at now has the security boxes and tags on meat and cheese. I don't know what the current law is but when I worked retail in my first job (about 8 years ago now) I was always told to never get involved, it wasn't worth risking injury for a company that would probably replace you while you are still in A&E waiting for treatment.",
    "I'm surprised it has taken this long. Greggs I walk past on my way to work I've seen shoplifters run out with pockets full of stuff about 3 times this year alone.",
    "As others have said I've noticed more of people in their 20's going. I'm now the only one of my group who isn't going and am very tempted. From what my friends say yes it has a larger older section but more and more younger people and families are attending. We've even got 2 new lads from it to join our football group in the evenings.",
    "Not over 35 (I'm 29) but I miss being around 13-16 this would be like 2009-2012 time and just heading out on our bikes after school, heading to the park and playing football for a couple of hours and cause none of us were rich we didn't have smart phones to be addicted to. Just regular phones that could call and text for emergencies.\n\nWe were stupid, tried a jump and cut your elbow but it wasn't record and online forever. Everyone forgot about it a week later. \n\nAlso the world felt safer. Our parents let us out for hours everyday until the street lights came on and you had to go home. Now being an adult I don't see kids and teenagers hardly anywhere and the ones I do see are all addicted to their screens. They never look like they are having fun or being silly like I was at that age and it makes me sad to see.",
    "We really should talk about it more. I work with people aged 18-24 so they were between 13-19 when it started in 2020. Now I know this isn't everyone but the majority of these young people now really struggle mentally and probably won't ever recover. They can't hold down a normal job, can't cope with going into an educational environment. So most are just at home everyday with their family except when they come in to see us. A lot are now addicted to drugs/alcohol etc. A lot get passed on to more serious services and become hospital inpatients. Any time we raise it with higher ups it gets brushed off as they are just becoming NEET's like we see already in places like Japan etc. No one wants to face the issues. It's being brushed under the carpet and I really worry what will happen because of it.",
    "My guess is that like most shows it probably started out a large part real as people who were entertaining and had fun cool talents wanted so sign up and show them off. Over the years that number has gotten lower and lower (Youtube and social media are the go to for anyone my age or younger) so they have to reach out to acts to fill the numbers. It's why you always see people saying \"x act has been on the american one\" or another country's version of the show. \n\nPlus add in now people think if they appear or tv and are quirky or stand out a little they might be able to turn it into a career as an influencer so you've no idea if people's stories are genuine or not. \n\nThe voting being influenced wouldn't surprise me I've always had a feeling stuff like that is somehow dodgy behind the scenes.",
    "M&S\n\nSainsbury\n\nTesco-Morrisons-Asda All about equal to me.\n\nRest either I've never been too or I don't have near me. I will add my favourite is probably Asda.",
    "Way too many bad stories for me to even download the app. I don't really understand the whole buying packs and letting someone else open them thing that has taken off in recent years too. Hope you get it fixed.",
    "I like the new anime I just wish there was a more catching and battling focus. We get the odd battle with the person of the week etc like the dragon biker gang this week but it wasn't super exciting like a gym battle would have been with Ash. Also almost 100 episodes in now and our main cast have 2 or 3 pokemon each. I know we were spoilt with Goh catching every episode but it felt like by this point Ash usually has a pretty established line up.\n\nAs I said I like it but I wish it had that little bit more.",
    "Happened to me in around about year 3/4. Was quite a popular thing. A few of us all paired up and did the fake wedding with paper rings and had someone else be the vicar etc. It's funny looking back on it.",
    "Was similar when I was in secondary school and that was the early 2010's. Kids throwing chairs and books and equipment at teachers. I dated a woman who was a science teacher at a secondary and she lasted about 5 years before quitting because of the violence and abuse from kids. She told me her and other teachers she worked with thought it won't be until a couple of teachers are seriously hurt (hospitalised or even killed) before anyone takes it seriously.",
    "I like horizons, it isn't perfect but I enjoy tuning in each week for the new episode. My only complaint is I'd like more catching and battling but I've always wanted that from every series. It feels like we are 100 episodes in almost and our three main characters don't have a full team of 6. Dot has two. Roy has three and Liko has three.",
    "I agree with you but it just won't happen. A lot of people here and who aren't part of reddit have really bad FOMO and will also fund scalpers. I'm part of two facebook groups and the posts selling Prismatic gets sold within less than 10 minutes every time even at 2x the retail price. Yes you get people clowning on them in the comments too but it also sells and very fast. \n\nI learnt long ago every product isn't for me. I didn't see any Surging or Prismatic at retail stores so just set aside that money for a future set.",
    "Not for me but I can see why others enjoy it.",
    "Probably linked to the internet and social media that people get into crazy debt to show off their \"perfect\" life. \n\nA woman at my work is addicted to Klarna, puts every purchase she can on it, hair appointments, nails, make up, even a takeaway. Whatever you can think of you can probably put it on it. Scared me from ever touching the app. \n\nI understand why people might take on some debt but I'd just be too scared so I don't risk it any live within my means.",
    "If I watched it weekly I'd have probably dropped it with how varied the pacing is. My go to is to wait for an arc to finish airing and then watch it from start to finish in my own time. I enjoy the manga too.",
    "Couldn't tell you the first but I have fond memories of pokemon, yugioh, sailor moon and cardcaptor sakura around about 2001/2002. All fantastic shows.",
    "Popped into mine on my lunch break today and I was told they sold out and won't be getting more in.",
    "I tried Argos and my local card shop about an hour ago on my lunch break and they were already all gone. I'm stubborn so won't pay scalper prices and just save my money for the next release.",
    "I'm not 30 yet (29) but one day a week I usually babysit my niece and nephew. Whenever the weather is nice I'll take them to the local play park and spend an hour or two there. This is the only time I get approached by women.",
    "Blue dragon is honestly one of my favourites. I've gone back to it many times over the years. It is regularly on sale too. I was a teen when I got it and it clicked with me and I loved every second of it",
    "I don't think it was over printed or hated it just was a time in Pokemon where a lot of us who grew up with Red/Blue got to our teen years and dropped out of pokemon for a few years. Now those same people are older and have more money they went back into vintage a few years back. I think once the age group that HG/SS were their first games get a bit older they will go back to this era of product and it will see a good level of growth.",
    "These things are a hard watch but always interest me. I wish there was some sort of follow up over the years to see if anyone got better.",
    "From people I deal with it seems to be an \"anti mainstream parties\" vote. They don't trust Labour or Tories. After Reform a lot openly say they voted Lib Dem or even Green party at the locals.",
    "I open a booster box on release for fun and then over the following months buy the singles to complete the set. It's the most fun in my opinion.",
    "BBC has many news articles from teachers saying anywhere from 10-25% of their class isn't potty trained. I even saw one article from a teacher who teaches Year 1 (6 year olds) saying a child in her class isn't potty trained. \n\nI dated a teacher's assistant and she had many stories of similar experiences. Not being able to change their clothes for PE, able to communicate about needing the toilet, even talking and making friends. Her theory is that some of it is down to lazy parents and also that these kids were born or had their toddler years during covid where interactions were limited and their social skills were stunted.",
    "Went on a few dates with a girl and it was great then around date 4 or 5 she invites me back to her place. It's horrible. The smell hit as soon as the door opened and I almost gagged. Mold, rubbish bags piling up in the kitchen, a layer of grimey and dust everywhere. Not as bad as those hoarder tv shows but a few more years and she is getting to be one of them. I got my brother to call and come up with an excuse to get me out. My guess is that it is more common than you think.",
    "I've never understood it either. Didn't happen much in secondary school but was very often at primary. My guess is over protective parents?",
    "Not in the countryside but not in a town or city either and it's bad. The bus is once every half an hour during the day and once an hour after 6pm until 10pm. I'm probably one of the few that have had good experiences with trains.",
    "Watched one too many Rattle videos to know that app is full of scammers. Literally 50% of singles I buy from CardMarket and Ebay come with a Whatnot advert inside to sign up for free money. It's so annoying",
    "My bad. I saw the limit of one and thought it was a limited restock. I needed a PC version of the ETB for my sealed collection so I'm happy but thanks for the heads up.",
    "I agree. I've only ever got as far as about 10 episodes in. It never grabs me and has me excited for more. Tried many times over the years but it's just not for me.",
    "For me it's FMA/FMAB I say this every time a post like this comes up and once have even got a death threat in the messages because of it. \n\nFriends for almost 10 years now tell me how amazing it is. The wider anime community seems to love it and holds it up as a masterpiece. Yet for me after 4 attempts in my life to watch it the show never clicks. I never have that moment where at the end of an episode I'm excited for the next one. Furthest I've got is maybe 10 episodes? I'm happy for those of you that love it but for it just isn't a show for me.",
    "Got a Shrouded Fable ETB but had to do 2 puzzle sliders before getting in the site and another 2 before paying. 100% I think this is PC adding extra layers to bot detection.",
    "Someone will 100% buy it. Always happens.",
    "I work with zoomers mostly aged 18-24. The ones I work with are what is increasingly called NEETs (Not in Education Employment or Training). A lot have mental health issues or have been abused growing up. This is just what I've learnt from working with them not the whole zoomer gen feel this way.\n\nThese people ditched leftist ideas still in their early teens. They don't care about left or right they just want someone to take charge and get things done. They are against immigration as a whole legal and illegal and openly talk \"I'd deport everyone who's come since Blair opened the borders in the 90's). \n\nThey've been told from multiple angles that they are bad just for being a straight White male. So of course they are going to reject whatever told them that and want to burn it down. \n\nThey have a view that is totally different to the rest of us. You gave examples of protesting they'd throw it back at you and say \"what did it accomplish? Nothing. If protesting worked we wouldn't be allowed to do it\".\n\nIt is honestly a miracle that the majority of these types numb themselves daily with Porn/Drugs/Alcohol or slip into virtual worlds with gaming. They are angry desperate. \n\nIf something doesn't change the numbers of people who feel this way and similar will continue to grow. It really worries me.",
    "I really struggle to click with sports. The only one I really enjoyed was \"One Outs\" and that while being based around a sport (Baseball) has a psychological twist.",
    "Similar here. All the drops from surging to this one I\u2019ve managed to get it added to cart. Put my card details in and booted out.",
    "After working with people in their late teens to early 20's (18-24) for the past few years they simply don't care about WW2.",
    "Pulling people down. I work with a lot of younger people (18-24) and when I see them really improving and applying to colleges or courses to get qualifications and try improve their lives I praise them and encourage them to keep going. A good portion of them when they get a letter accepting them into the college/course and take it home I\u2019m assuming their families nag and belittle them until they drop out. \n\nI think it might be tall poppy syndrome?",
    "I always say the same on posts like this..\n\nFMA/FMAB isn\u2019t a 10/10 masterpiece that the every person will love and enjoy. \n\nLiterally just that sentence there has annoyed people so much I\u2019ve received death threats in my messages. \n\nI\u2019ve tried it many times over the years and can never get more than 10 episodes deep. It just doesn\u2019t click with me and give me that \u201cI\u2019m excited for the next episode\u201d feeling.\n\nIf you enjoy it I\u2019m happy for you but for me it\u2019s just not for me.",
    "For someone who usually votes Independent it would probably help them get more representation. So I\u2019d like to see it happen.\n\nThe Tories and Labour probably would lose the most seats if it happened so my guess is it won\u2019t happen unless some serious pressure is applied",
    "My guess is eventually we will see something top it. Will probably take a few years but it will happen eventually. \n\nShocks me that Demon Slayer is at 5 and not higher. Just from my IRL experience almost daily on my walk to and from work I come across people wearing merch from the show. It seems to have really broken into the mainstream and I see kids and adults always in shirts and hoodies or accessories on their phones and backpacks etc.",
    "I like it and look forward to the latest episode each week. I felt it went too fast. Lucius, Gibeon and Rystal went on a journey that seemed like it took them a good few years to accomplish (Yes I understand they wouldn't have had the technology our main cast had access to). Liko, Roy and Dot seemed to follow that journey in a matter of months and to me it felt a bit rushed? \n\nI'd have liked to see it take a bit longer and our gang catch and develop a relationship with a few more pokemon. \n\nLong story short I'd have liked things to have been more fleshed out and it felt a little rushed.",
    "You\u2019ve just got to understand his audience isn\u2019t people like me (I\u2019m 29) and probably you too. The loud over the top performative videos this guy makes are for kids and it works. \n\nA YouTuber faking pulls? Nothing would surprise me",
    "Solo levelling was fun. Was it a great show? No. Will it be remembered as a masterpiece that in 10 years we are telling everyone to watch? No. Did I enjoy sitting down and watching each new episode ? Yeah. It\u2019s a solid 5 or 6 out of ten. Something fun but nothing mind blowing. \n\nBeing a fun show is perfectly acceptable. No every release has to be this 10/10 best show ever.",
    "A lot of us probably got into manga from one of the big three shonen series. In my case it was Pokemon, Yugioh and Sailor Moon in the late 90's/early 2000's. I've got those on my shelf. Stuff like Yu Yu Hakusho and MAR. Cardcaptor Sakura. Drifters. Yes I even have some One Piece and Bleach. \n\nIn years to come if these newer fans are still in the manga community they will probably have branched out and tried more niche series.",
    "I'm not sure if this counts but I'd love a series on following Professor Oak's story. Starting from as a young trainer getting his first Pokemon to how he ended up as a league winner? how his friendship with Agatha started and if they went on any adventures together? how it turned bad and they seemingly don't talk anymore? What encouraged him to go down the professor/researching path. Starting the lab and all the struggles that come along with that.",
    "Doesn\u2019t bother me if it\u2019s out in the street. If you are going into a shop or somewhere please put it back on.",
    "The tough reality we need to accept is that the best role model is probably your dad. If you\u2019ve got a good dad who cares and puts time in and teaches you right from wrong, good morals and everything else that is needed you\u2019ve got a good chance that child grows up to be a decent person.\n\nYes having other positive role models in the extended family or a great teacher at school probably helps too. \n\nFor me and a lot of my mates growing up we didn\u2019t look up to a footballer or tv star.",
    "Probably going to sound like an old man when I say this (I\u2019m only 29). I pay in cash whenever I can. Having it physically in my hand helps me budget for the weeks and months ahead. \n\nI\u2019ve seen 2 friends in my life get into crazy debt on credit cards just tapping the card for every purchase. So while I do use a card sometimes the majority I leave it at home.",
    "I go through phases with gaming. Sometimes I\u2019ll have a few months where I\u2019ll play nothing. Then a few months where I play mostly switch, or PC or Xbox. It really depends on what\u2019s been released and if anything looks fun.",
    "Think I got 2?",
    "This is kinda true. If you bring up anything popular like Attack on Titan or One Piece or something from back in the day like pokemon/yugioh etc that stigma seems to have gone. \n\nIf I showed my MAL and my last entry is [https://myanimelist.net/anime/57719/Akuyaku\\_Reijou\\_Tensei\\_Ojisan](https://myanimelist.net/anime/57719/Akuyaku_Reijou_Tensei_Ojisan) because it's the last show I watched then the stigma would almost 100% stil be there.",
    "I work with younger lads (18-24 year olds) who belong to a group best described as NEETs (Not in Education Employment or Training). I make it a point to never bring up politics but if they bring it up I'll listen. Many don't bring it up at all but there has been maybe 30-40 (out of the hundreds if not closer to 1000-2000 young people we've helped) over the few years that have discussed it. To many the last general election was their first or second time voting. From what I've managed to work out it splits into a few different camps. \n\n1. Middle finger vote. This is the most common I've heard. \n\nThey just don't care and think it will be funny to piss everyone off.\n\n2. Anti Immigration vote. This is obvious. \n\nYou'll hear ranging views from \"just deporting all the boat people\" to \"everyone after the boris wave\" which I had no clue and had to ask and it seems to mean everyone (Legal and illegal) who has arrive since Boris took charge. To the most extreme I've heard where everyone again legal and illegal who has arrived since Tony Blair took charge.\n\n3. Don't trust the Tory/Labour/Lib Dems to be able to provide a future they are willing to join society for. (This is the smallest group yet one I worry about the most)\n\nThey won't bother joining the workforce and society as a whole unless we return to the past. By this they usually mean to be able to have a home and able to raise a family on one person's wage like how either their dad or grandad's generation did. Not a life of luxury but to be able to keep their head above water. Their partner/girlfriend/wife can be as one said a \"trad wife\". Which I took to mean a 1950's housewife and not need to work and just focused on chores/errands/child raising. \n\nThese young lads/men openly talk about waiting for it all to burn down and how they numb themselves with porn or alcohol or drugs or gaming. They joke about wanting a 21st century Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar to come along and just get rid of bureaucracy and get stuff done. As show by the independent article linked below. \n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/genz-dictatorship-survey-jordan-peterson-b2686927.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/genz-dictatorship-survey-jordan-peterson-b2686927.html)\n\nMore than half (52 per cent) of Gen Z\u00a0think the UK would be a better place if a strong leader \u201cwho does not have to bother with parliament and elections\u201d was in charge.\n\nAt the moment as a society we just ignore these people or call them stupid or racist. It is probably viewed as a good thing by those in power that these young men do numb themselves with their vices because the other options are too scary to think about.",
    "29 and I play on my walk to and from work so maybe 90 minutes a day?",
    "I just tell myself they must be younger or haven\u2019t heard someone not agree with them.",
    "Both FMA adaptations aren\u2019t the \u201c10/10 best anime ever made\u201d that everyone tells me it is. I\u2019ve tried multiple times over the years and it never hooks me in. Furthest I\u2019ve got is 10 episodes deep before just turning off.\nI\u2019ve even had death threats in messages over saying I just didn\u2019t enjoy it.",
    "I jumped in on the Lite quite soon after it was released. It\u2019s fantastic.",
    "One lad went on and played football at league 1 level so not crazy premier league money but probably enough to live a nice life? Another is/was part of a small band and always posted pics on tour round pubs and clubs across the country. \n\nMinus being rich I might fit this. The early years of secondary school I was well behaved and quiet but the last 2 years after being in a rough incident I was rude, ditched a lot and honestly a dick. I had a few teachers who openly said I wouldn't do anything in life. It was only because I had a very kind science teacher who treated me like a real person and believed in me that I even passed my exams.\n\nI bounced around jobs but never found anything that I loved. Now 29 for the past few years I've worked helping young lads who have troubles themselves gain confidence and become independent and thrive. It doesn't pay well and some are hard work but I love it and for me that is a success.",
    "I like both. If I had to pick I'd choose Marmite. Both become sickly if I have too much.",
    "The messages I've had over just saying the show isn't for me is crazy. I've had people saying to end things.",
    "Not that it becomes horrible but it just doesn't hook/click with me and I turn it off. I say this whenever questions like this come up but its both FMA shows. Tried many times over the years to try as friends agree with a lot of the anime fanbase that \"It's a masterpiece\" \"My favourite show\" etc etc and it never clicks for me. Furthest I got was 10 episodes into FMAB and I just didn't care to continue.",
    "I'm not sure if this is controversial but we needed more screen time for Gildarts. A common phrase in tv is \"show don't tell\". In the anime we are always told how amazing Gildarts is and about how his quests take a long time (sometimes years). You can maybe use how easily he throws Natsu around the guild or gets him to submit in the Tenrou arc but I've always felt it doesn't do him justice. Just a short little arc or two (6-8 episodes that is all I'm asking for) following Gildarts on a quest just to help build the world on how powerful he really is compared to the main cast. \n\nI don't care for the shipping that a lot of people do. Not just in Fairy Tail but any anime I watch. Shipping doesn't interest me at all.",
    "I'd have liked it to be in the past. If they pull off a fun and interesting experience it will all be worth it.",
    "It\u2019s a placeholder date like others have said. I\u2019ve even seen a few sites with December 31 2099.",
    "Padding RPGs with boring fetch and delivery quests that are just there to pad the play time so you can brag to investors \"Time players spent in game is up 30% this month\". The saying \"Less is more\" exists for a reason.",
    "I say this on every post like this but for me it\u2019s both full metal alchemist adaptations. Tried multiple times over the years especially with friends saying how great it is. Furthest I\u2019ve got is 10 episodes and it just never clicks with me.",
    "I\u2019m a stubborn fool that refuses to pay these prices. I live in a smaller town and the only options for cards are supermarkets, Game and 2 tiny card shops. Since the release of Surging Sparks I\u2019ve seen none of the latest sets in shop. No Surging, Prismatic or Journey Together.\n\nPok\u00e9mon needs to up printing.",
    "Fortnite. The majority of my friend group played it a lot during covid and it just wasn\u2019t for me.",
    "Been a problem in many hobbies for decades. It sadly wont ever stop. Always someone with a bit of extra cash willing to pay more to get it day 1. We are a loud and vocal community who are against this but are a tiny minority when it comes to the amount of people who will buy a switch 2.",
    "Me and my dad are currently doing a carpentry project and I think it would be great to have any from the Tinkatink line to join in and hammer away when needed",
    "Does Prismatic even exist? I got lucky with a Binder collection on Amazon. Pulled some cool EX\u2019s. Just in stores I have seen 0. None in supermarkets. Game. The two local card shops in my little town. Just 0.",
    "I look at it the same way I look at Surging Sparks. It doesn't even exist. I opened one binder collection of Prismatic and got some cool Ex's apart from that I've not seen any in the wild. Can't be nostalgic for a set you didn't open.",
    "For me it happened a good few years ago. The majority of pundits we see probably retired in the late 2000's early 2010's which is why the coverage they did felt like they provided insight and could teach you something. Probably because the tactics were similar to how they played. \n\nNeville retired in 2011 which is almost 15 years ago and football has changed a lot in that time which is why a lot of his predictions are wrong and he just sounds like an old man moaning (An example of this is his \"players are robots\" rant the other weekend because players pass the ball around the defence and don't always take on the defender when 1v1) \n\nCarragher isn't perfect but seems to love the game and keep up with the latest in football plus with MNF + guests you actually feel like you are learning something.",
    "I enjoy the new direction the anime has taken. Is it perfect? Nope but do I enjoy tuning in weekly and seeing what adventures Liko and Roy and everyone get up to? Yes",
    "I've a close knit group of 8 friends and I, every one of us wants kids. Only 3 of the group do. Should add I'm 29 and our group is 27-32. If you asked us this question 10 years ago everyone would have said nope. I think it changes for some people as you get older.",
    "I don't know who beta squad are but I know who sidemen are. I don't mind the occasional laugh and joke becasue it is natural but with how often it happens it just feels fake and manufactured.",
    "This is exactly what I wanted SAO to be. Multiple episodes per floor. How relationships are built and strained by what is happening to them and other players. Little mini arcs (4-6 episodes) of the cast finding out about a rare mob that spawns that drops an item that could be a huge buff to them.  \n\nCould have made for a multi series epic with 100+ episodes but it was so rushed. \n\nI'm still a fan and it's a guilty pleasure and I've a soft spot for the Alicization series.",
    "No idea if or why Reddit hates AOT. I loved the first season. The rest of it didn't hit the same but I still had fun watching. I gave it an 8 on MAL."
