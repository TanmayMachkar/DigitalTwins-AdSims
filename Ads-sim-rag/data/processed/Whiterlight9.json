IF Biden were an issue as your questions imply THEN that still doesnt make Trumps actions ok, 2 wrongs dont make a right. Thats on top of - the media lies everyday under Trump by not correcting his blatant lies, contradictions and utter lack of grammar or do you really believe him every timr ge says \"nobodys as good at ___ as I am, im the best at ___\"",
