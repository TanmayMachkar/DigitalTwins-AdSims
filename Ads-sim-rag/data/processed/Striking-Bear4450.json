    "Android 18, no need for a reason she's just a mommy",
    "Dragon in my pants",
    "Returner's magic should be special, I don't think it's transmigration but this shit that they claim peak is trash, it's a manhwa but I think it's just a colored manga because it's really just a manga with the story and character writing",
    "At this point the creator is just a furry lover",
    "Love the seductive lortelle but i'm on team Lucy\ud83d\ude14",
    "What's an A tier when there's a peak tier",
    "Like how do you cultivate it\ud83d\ude06",
    "Damn ass made you want to read it\ud83d\ude06",
    "And one's opinion isn't everything, if it's trash to you so be it but if it isn't to others that's it too, they have their own opinions just like you",
    "Who even liked remedios?",
    "No wonder characters from manga retires from battlefield when their knees gets injured, there's no protection",
    "Returners magic should be special? Something like that, mc is just too unbearable he's like one of those characters with characters that acts nice and stuff? Especially when he keeps talking and smiling with eyes closed, I just hated it so much it reminds me of other characters I already forgot but can still see the image inside my head, those pretentious looking characters mc that's written as a good guy but just looks like a character with hidden intentions?? Just remembering that mc annoys me",
    "Still a fact he couldn't hide his power so yup not the final boss at hiding his power idk why you're trying to explain so hard to deny this fact and just so you know cid never intended to reveal his power yup but still couldn't hide it from the first girl he saved that formed the shadow garden group",
    "So he never fought a character that can bypass negate yet or his verse just doesn't have a character with the ability",
    "Thank you very much\ud83e\udef6",
    "Some showed signs of doubt if he's really weak or just pretending, not the shadows, forgot the girl's name and yup since the shadows knows he's actually strong it just shows that he failed at hiding his power so yea cid is not the final boss of hiding his power",
    "I enjoyed \"Dangerous Dungeon Escape\" it's like a streamer one too",
    "He failed at hiding power since there are people who knows his power and doubted his fake weak side",
    "I think senior is too sensitive, I've read worse scriptures that makes this feel like an ant compared to a dragon",
    "Fella pure sis",
    "It's crazy how you think baki is the strongest at the 1dollar characters, love baki but that's just so exaggerated to say he's the strongest when Edward and eren is there, martial art can't do shit to a gigantic titan and baki won't even be able to touch ed",
    "I did and it says +7 is max",
    "Iron butler, parr, she's my main ally, can also be acquired from ally recruitment",
    "Aren't those from other versions of elona and not from elona mobile? And as for pet just keep one you like even if it doesn't have good stats at first like S stats since you can swap stats when you get copies of the same ally if you get a copy with better stat, as for me i'm keeping the northerner butler as main pet, she a decent tank for me mainly because of her shield passive and my second main ally is the red ally bow girl from ally recruitment named chihiro I think? She's a good range with healing skills so she's worth using",
    "I only got the weapon from healing god and the machine god, i'll double check the stats later and i'm close to getting the magic god's wand and i'm sorry the link doesn't seem to work so I couldn't see the image, thank you for answering",
    "So it actually is just +7 max and need to get an item with fixed +13 con stat? Where to get this item or is it from gacha? I have no luck there",
    "So... Is this h? Judging from the art style it's similar to gangster action manhwas",
    "But selena is fun to use\ud83d\ude17",
    "While I do agree most players in mythical rank are usually much worse than players in legend, hell even players in grand master are so much better and chill since most mythical players are full of their egos thinking they're so much better than the rest and they have this mindset that when they have more kills they're better and this happened while I was using roam trying to stop two teammates arguing and then the core decides to put the blame on me as well like \"you're too slow\" heck what do they want me to do? Instantly flicker next to the enemies when I'm just walking away from our base? Reminder that tanks need their hp to tank and mana to help in teamfights \"score\" bitch kills aren't scores and when I unintentionally get the kill they'd complain about kill steal, I can't even rant anymore just remembering those dumbass mythical teammates stresses me out",
    "You get upvote for being too relatable",
    "Talk to gamish the beggar",
    "How bad do you have to be to cry on Reddit for help to counter one hero, hanabi solos sun, don't let it come closer and if it did gets too close to you use your ult to stop him and get some distance again, wind chant weapon thingy is recommended since sun's a pure physical dmg dealer and has 2 skills that lets him get closer to enemies\n\nValir can solo sun, lance can also solo suns with pure dmg build, many other heroes can just need the right timings when using skills",
    "Fuck the maid right away"
