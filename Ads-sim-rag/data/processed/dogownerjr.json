    "Why though?... That goes against the intended interactions of the ult. Watch they start rolling this out for all champions. Everyone gets to bring their shit to the death realm...",
    "The voice effects alone makes this one of my favorite skins!",
    "Damn that quality couldn't be any worse tho...",
    "I love this. If someone had the balls to do that, they would be the greatest of all time \ud83d\ude02",
    "Yep, been explaining that to folks for years. Black Americans don't truly have a place to belong anywhere in the world. But life goes on. It makes us stronger.",
    "\"you think one is cool? I'm bout to do three...fractures!\"",
    "Throw in a spear of shojin and thats the build i use on yorick! best tower breaking build!",
    "Tryndamere!",
    "Humans... We're the worst thing that's ever happened to this planet...",
    "I just think this AI vs non-ai has overcomplicated what art is. If someone looks at something and finds artistic value in it, then it's art. \n\nAI is a tool like anything else, and depending on how tools are used is what makes the difference.\n\nBut to be literal, the meriam Webster definition of art is \"the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects\". If a human lazily uses AI to generate images, it wouldn't, by definition, be art since the \"skill\" aspect is missing. But if intention, skill, and creativity are involved significantly in the creation, then it would, by definition, be art.",
    "What happened to \"art is in the eye of the beholder\"?",
    "Yep. All these changes have left me feeling kinda lost now. I've tried to adjust to everything since his winrate is still good, but he just doesn't *feel* right anymore. I've only ever played top Yorick, and all the jungle Yorick changes have ruined the feeling for me. And really there's no other champion feels remotely similar. I don't wanna play Nasus where I gotta play like a bitch until the last 5 minutes of the game where maybe I will matter...",
    "Last couple of seasons of seven deadly sins.",
    "Exactly! I miss my edgy Gaara. Like they couldn't make a good guy version with a similar personality as the kid version? But yea, glad they didn't force a relationship on him that didn't make sense.",
    "Honestly, I feel like her bio is pretty fair. Yea, it could be better but I know we've all seen much worse. I also feel like some of this stuff was meant to be lighthearted jokes, but doesn't seem like it was taken that way.",
    "Yes! Literally my favorite mini game they've ever had! So simple but so addicting!",
    "Ehhh, in terms of being in a relationship, not a huge fan of either. But if I HAVE to choose, it's Hinata. Just more my vibe.\n\nBut to choose anyone else, maybe Tenten. She seems chill.",
    "Looks dope! Great concept, but makes too much sense for Riot to actually do it \ud83d\ude02",
    "Never understood why they can't just turn those very specific skins off in those countries. Or just create a similar alternative or something. Didn't they do that for Karthus?",
    "Watch some AI language is gonna reference this one day \ud83d\ude02.",
    "Played a few games with him this morning. Feels like I have to work harder than before to do pretty much anything while also feeling noticeably squishier. It does feel nice to be able to spawn graves more frequently though.",

    "The Paarthurnax Dilemma, as someone else said.",
    "Well I do have a mod that lets you tell Delphine that you're letting parthunax live, allowing the quest to be completed.",
    "I deleted my level 35 summoner and it took 5 minutes",
    "Yep, that's why I do so many voice messages. Ironic that timder is like the only dating app that doesn't have a voice message feature...",
    "Not too often do internet videos genuinely make me smile but this one did it. Faith in humanity restored (for the next 30 minutes...)",
    "If the quality is worth it then yep.",
    "I agree with all of this except I would replace project sfx with psy ops. I just really like the weird random ghost-tech noises. Idk how else to describe it.",
    "I woulda went in, took the keys out, and locked the vehicle since they wanted to make the process even longer. Tell them to call the police if they have an issue then don't even respond...",
    "Yea my situation is completely different from yours but I feel the exact same. Life just sucks in general and I'm so jealous of a lot of people who got people that care about them. I genuinely don't have friends or family that really give af about me. I'm just swimming through life feeling like there's no point. I try to stay looking forward but it's hard ..",

    "Yuumi. Then teemo jungle. Then any mage junglers.",
    "Who fulfills the thigh fetish? Aurora?",
    "I should start using that during presentations. Instead of having empty space and to avoid saying \"umm\" too much, I'll just say cunts instead \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "I'd rather fight Jane than any of those robot bosses any day.",
    "Wow wtf are you me? I exclusively used lord mordekaiser before high noon came out. Those train sounds go hard. King of clubs used to be one of my favorites before the rework. Now it's my least favorite unfortunately.",

    "Tryhardamere...",
    "Isn't demacia pretty weak right now after the events of the mage rebellion and the black mist attacking them?",
    "Meanwhile league of legends casually throwing out skins for $200-$500...",
    "Exactly! Also no one is mentioning that most of riot's money from skins come from Korea. And they're not boycotting the prices. And these reddit communities aren't big enough to actually matter to riot. If people got money for the skin, buy the skin, if they don't, then don't... Riot isn't changing anything.",
    "Haha I don't think we have bars like that in my city \ud83d\ude02",
    "Where do people find speed dating opportunities?",
    "I don't have the words to show how much I feel this. I'm not quite exactly in your position but I'm really fucking close. Everything feels meaningless and no one around me gives a fuck. I don't even have people around me to give a fuck.",
    "Yea I was in that exact situation actually. It was pitch black on the countryside around 7pm I think. I'm not a devout Christian or anything, but I started talking to God and it randomly stopped barking and moving then walked away unusually calmly. One of the weirdest interactions with a dog I've had.",
    "Lol wtf are you me? Because you sound exactly like me! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "As someone that doesn't read manga, I like going into the comments to see discussions on what the anime did differently from the manga or those people that detail important information that was cut out. Also sometimes people give very insightful opinions or theories on things that happened in that episode. I get a lot of satisfaction from a healthy comments community. I've always known gogo to be like that too. 9anime, on the other hand, was always so hostile in their comments section.",
    "That could have been an old note for an AmazonXL delivery. AmazonXL has inside entryway, room of choice, and unpack services.",
    "Was hoping someone would mention this one! I think it started off kinda slow but the story is so well written! The ending was done so well too! Love seeing the different character struggles and their growth. They did the time skip really well where other shows usually struggle with that.",
    "If I was to assume her age off of appearance, she looks about 45 years old. How do people make it that far without getting a reality check before that point?...",

    "To answer your question, yes, I would say Samsung internet is better. I was using firefox on desktop and mobile but finally got fed up with it and moved to Brave on both. I've had the best browser experience ever since then. Highly recommend Brave.",
    "Yea, it looks like we can just straight up craft perfect trinodes now. Duky has been posting some great videos about everything!",
    "True but aren't they giving us like all the perfect nodes this time around? Or did I just make that up? \ud83d\ude02",
    "I mean, I don't care a HUGE amount about damage since I know all classes are viable right now. But I know the last time I tried thunder breaker, his damage seemed a bit lower than others when I hit 200. \n\nAesthetics definitely are important for me. For example, as good as Lara is, I could never take it seriously because of the aesthetic. Same with Angelic buster. Mobility is important too but most classes have pretty good mobility now. Off the top of my head, kaiser is one of the few classes that feels horrible to move around to me.",
    "What would you say feels the best between NW and WA? Since I'll be grinding in 5th job for a minute, we'll put more weight on the 5fh job experience rather than 6th.",
    "Do yea I just don't have the hands for Kain but I really want to fuck him because I LOVE edgy characters. And his theme music goes crazy on that one one skill \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo you're recommending WA, NW, and Bucc. Thank you!",
    "Some of the comments in here are wild. Tipping culture is way out of hand.",
    "Hugging a wall and standing there is the most satisfying thing for me when fiora ults. Funny just watching her dash around trying to get that weak point while autoing her to death. But then her bs parry slows my attack speed down to nonexistence so I'm just standing there looking stupid too...",
    "Crazy to me that the average person isn't using an ad blocker.",
    "Damn, came here looking for this post :/. Hope this isn't the beginning of the end. Sites have been dropping like flies.",
    "Wow that's actually insane how good that is!",
    "When I was doing amazonxl, crazy how many people said Amazon told them not to let the driver leave until they checked the condition of the package... And I'm like, sorry but Amazon don't give me enough time for that...",
    "If you paying 11 dollars for 1 Domino's pizza, you doing something wrong. They got that deal that's always available for 2 pizzas for 6.99 each.",
    "I'll get this out the way and say bleach.\n\nBut also classic dragon ball z (Bruce faulconer composer), made in abyss, Naruto, attack on Titan, twin Star exorcists (don't remember the story that much but I remember the soundtrack being pretty good)",
    "I hate pretty much all of the machine enemies. I don't think anyone else is hard or annoying.",
    "Oh wtf really?! Is that a new thing or it's been there for a while? I wonder if it actually does anything or if Amazon just put it there to make it look like they give a fuck.",
    "Ok this guy gotta be into the shaming fetish or whatever it's called right?",
    "Haven't watched it in forever but wouldn't no game no life count? Or am I forgetting something?",
    "Anything that requires me to log in daily is what I usually drop when my schedule gets tight. I grew up with MMOs but I don't have time for the commitment they require from me. Casually playing competitive games or just picking up random solo games have been the best for me and felt satisfying to squeeze into my schedule.",
    "I think this is the best thing I've listened to all week \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: wtf didn't realize that was an 8 minute video!",

    "Unless they changed it, don't they read those texts on their Amazon account? And they get closed off after a certain amount of time? That's how I thought it worked but correct me if wrong.",
    "This why there should be a way for drivers to leave 'feedback' for customers...",
    "I know what sub this is but that's really fucked up. This why we can't have nice things...",
    "That's wild.",
    "Kinda wild so many folks here thinks it's cool to write on person's home. If I can't verify an address, I'll just take it back. They'll learn when they not getting what they delivered.",
    "Surprised no one said God of Highschool. I didn't read the source material but I heard it was worlds better than the anime. And it's probably the only anime I've ever seen where I had absolutely no idea wtf was going on.",
    "Lelouch, Luffy, Boruto",
    "Am I the only one that thinks the woman is probably just as toxic?..",
    "There's literally an old article somewhere out there with Bezos pretty much saying exactly that. It's quite literally designed into the system.",
    "I typically have always built yorick to double down on what he does best: splitting and taking structures. I would build Trinity, Titanic, hullbreaker, spear of shojin, and whatever else he needs at that point.\n\nBut I also love watching maiden 1v1 people and think it would be fun to have a for-fun build that focused on that. I remember a while ago watching a jungle yorick getting hella kills throughout the game by just sending maiden down lanes. I don't remember the build though. I think they used first strike though.",
    "Damn, I wanted comment that \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Tokyo ghoul. Started off so interesting but the last season was just...a lot...",
    "Idk how y'all just be letting y'all cats walk on the place where food is prepared.",
    "Saitama - auto wins for comedic effect\n\nEren - all that different timeline manipulation or whatever it is is cracked\n\nAsta - anti magic for insurance \n\nJotaro - stopping time op",
    "Yep. Happened at my station before too when I still worked there. They said it \"wasn't in the budget\"...",
    "Or could sign up for a 24/7 gym and go hitting a punching bag after work everyday",
    "Yea for sure. I agree that of you're going to grind, it would make sense to use frenzy. I'm just saying that's it not a necessity to do it. Making it seem like a necessity is how many have burned out when just doing dailies and some bossing is also viable.",
    "I'm not seeing what was so obvious that they were only talking about the grinding aspect of progression in the game. It's completely viable to get to 260 simply by doing your dailies now. 99% implies that you *have* to get the service to get to 260 when that isn't true. Which is why I mentioned it. Thought that was fairly obvious.",
    "I'm replying to the thread because it's relevant to me... Not sure where you got the speaking for other people thing from and hardly ever playing but if making stuff ups makes you happy then more power to ya.",
    "But that's also a way that would burn a lot of people out making them think that's the only viable option.",
    "Well the whole point of being a daily story player is to progress... through dailies. So you don't *need* to grind. Unless you're also referring to grinding via dailies. In which case, frenzy service is unnecessary.",
    "It's just unnecessary for me to enjoy the game. I get my dailies out the way then go do other shit.",
    "I've never used frenzy service even once, and I've been around for its entire existence. But I'm also a seasonal, daily-story player.",
    "Naruto before he had control over Kurama, and most Bleach transformations were some of my highest highs as a kid!",
    "Bixby sucks but I've never had issues with Google assistant. Works every time for me and I get good responses.",
    "I watched one episode on there and the subs turned me off. They were so out of sync.",
    "You mean Minnie said you were fucking Goofy? \ud83e\udd28",
    "Idk man, dub in certain older anime sound phenomenal. But the newer ones are cringe",
    "They're the same folks. 9anime rebranded to aniwave. So you're using a fake site.",
    "Are there any main alternatives for the box sites that everyone is using?",
    "I think it gets a bad rep simply because a computer is doing so much of the work. I think it's healthiest to view it as any other tool.",
    "Well technically I guess I did draw using AI tools\ud83d\ude02. I guess I'll take back my previous statement! I dabble in the artistic field \ud83d\ude0e.",
    "If drawing was one of the skills I was blessed with then sure \ud83d\ude02. Fun is subjective.",
    "That makes some sense. Chatgpt and copilot uses dall e to generate pictures I believe. I put the same requests into copilot and got completely different results. Chatgpt did a much better job at capturing morde I think.",

    "I still don't know how to get the Jump High achievement :/",
    "I never knew morde had a special effect when getting a pentakill.",
    "Saitama - pretty normal dude. Not as much of a wild card as goku\n\nEren - big brain\n\nAsta - anti magic could be super useful and he's a cool dude\n\nJotaro - he really shouldn't be in the $1 section cuz time manipulation op",
    "My balls dropped multiple times while watching this...",
    "Lelouch (the show is good but I've always thought it was kinda overhyped)\n\nLuffy (I'm a one piece hater)\n\nBoruto (no explanation needed)",
    "Mihile. It's been going smoother than I was expecting. Feels much better than the paladin I tried to burn.",
    "Paladin. I was just expecting more I guess. Didn't realize how dependent it is on being in a party to get his damage out. I only play solo so bossing kinda sucked. But hey, impossible to die.",
    "As people have already said, e gives more pen and lower cool down on your only engage/escape tool\n\nBut if you're getting better results with W instead then fk it. People have different play styles.",
    "He did himself a favor. Good for him.",
    "It's wild to me that people like that can even get matches. Meanwhile I can't get a single match on several different dating apps",
    "I simply just don't have the type of money Breaks Plus want me to spend. I'd rather have a poor job done for cheap than nothing done at all.",
    "I called them recently for an oil change and they're booked for next couple weeks they said.",
    "I'm over here wishing I had more Chicia copies. She does solo much damage. I have Calcharo too and he's been nothing but disappointing.",
    "Tryndamere every time.",
    "Do you have any landlords you could recommend?",
    "I really wanna stay under 600 dollars a month. So that would be less than 1200 for a 2 bed.",
    "I could definitely check some of those places out. Any recommendations on finding parking?",
    "Is this party open to people from out of state? \ud83d\udc40",
    "Hey I'm also visiting for the eclipse. Let me know if you find any cool places you think I should check out!",
    "Epic Games. I'm so impressed on how they run Fortnite. And they have the funds to do whatever they want.",
    "Ark. I love playing the Naruto of MapleStory. Also I love all the demonic- looking particles cleaning up the mobs behind me after I use my skills. And bursting down bosses looks epic.",
    "Blows my mind how easily this animal shreds through these cars like cardboard.",
    "Me personally, I only play during the winter and summer events because I feel motivated to level up new characters with the level up events and the usually helpful event shop. I enjoy making new characters and the main concerns of the game don't really effect the early game leveling experience for me.",
    "I'm a pretty casual player and I only really play for new/reworked characters or summer/winter events. A lot of the concerns for the active player base aren't concerns for me. So it would take something like making my main, Ark, unplayable or getting rid of my server, Bera. I'm not willing to start the journey over.",
    "Very true. After talking to someone for that long, you would have thought she would have explored his profile for deal breakers like height. However, there's nothing wrong with people having a height preference, like you said. Can't control what people are attracted to.",
    "You won the Internet for today \ud83d\ude02",
    "MapleStory, Aion Online, Elsword, Grand Chase, Wizard101",
    "Ark. I love the theme, reminds of Naruto going berserk, and he makes stuff pop up on the screen to clean up mobs!",
    "We got ours at my dsp about a month ago",
    "Exactly! People don't talk about this enough. Everyone slaps on the word \"execute\" to things that aren't executes. They're actually just true damage or bonus damage. Eve ult, for example, is not an execute.",
    "Been complaining about that since forever. Blows my mind that we don't have a dedicated delivery device.",
    "Only 1-2 pinks for the entire match? I think you should be using a pink AT LEAST for every objective fight. So for a full match that reaches endgame, that would be 5 pinks for drakes, 1 pink for the 2nd herald, and probably 2 pinks for 2 barons. That's 8 right there, and thats not even including regular vision denial during laning phase.",
    "Sweeper and umbral still can't do what pink wards do. For example, placing a pink ward while fighting drake safely prevents the enemy team from getting vision on drake.",
    "What server are you on \ud83d\ude2e? I'm just curious",
    "$18.75 before the raise. $20.75 now",
    "Sounds like a Black Mirror episode",
    "Thank you! Yea I'm definitely gonna work on getting those bigger bags. Would be game changing having more space for that stuff.",
    "The visual is super helpful! Thank you for that and the suggestions!",
    "Yes, I'm on reg server. I forgot to mention that. Understood! I've been neglecting life skills since forever. I'll have to work on that soon. I'll probably move to a different character temporarily though.",
    "I'm on reg server. I keep forgetting to mention that when I make these posts.",
    "Thank you for the advice!  \n\n\nhere's a screenshot with the bags open too: [https://imgur.com/a/lCtZo6N](https://imgur.com/a/lCtZo6N)",
    "Am I the only person that wish we could see this from a further perspective just to rule out any trickery?",
    "Okay great! That's really relieving to know. I've never actually had to use an image backup before, so I don't know exactly how it works.",
    "If you play the game with the music on, you should look into which skins change the maiden music and go off what sounds the best to you.",
    "Is there a place I can be notified?",
    "Sent you a DM. I play league, and a bunch of other games, with some buddies on discord. Been wanting more people around town though to meet.",
    "Will something like this be happening again?",
    "Right! I'm making 18 doing AmazonXL..",
    "What do you do for work?",
    "Yes! I probably did this the most recently. My hotspot speeds were faster than Starbucks and the university's guest connection, but still slow overall. I had no idea that was unique to TMobile though since I've never been with any other carrier.",
    "I use T-Mobile. It's very 'mid' over here in Iowa. I'm unwilling to change carriers, though, because I don't pay for my own phone plan currently.",
    "I used to be an engineering student, and the engineering building was the best place for me for my internet needs. The art building on the west side was also really nice. I'm no longer a student anymore though.",
    "I tried the guest connection at the mall downtown and it was pretty slow for me.",
    "I tried this yesterday, and they've had the fastest wifi, surprisingly.",

    "Came for Pyke. Stayed for the space bar. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",

    "One bottle was never enough. I always brought 2 with me.",
    "Well Irelia counters yorick hard asf. But obviously you still gotta know what you're doing on her.",
    "If yorick holds W until morde ults, there's no threat. I play both champions a lot and it's really just a skill matchup.",

    "Someone wanna explain why all my comments are getting down voted? Or just the reddit hive mind?",
    "Yea, my goal is 250. I'm taking a break to focus on life stuff when the event is over.",
    "Where do I get the 3x exp?",
    "Well that's reassuring. That's not too bad.",
    "Where do you buy tickets with mesos from?",
    "So basically just have to grind it out. Grinding is ridiculously slow for me though. But seems like that's the only option.",
    "Well I'm asking if it's realistically possible to make it to 250 before the event ends.  \n\n\nI only have 6 MP tickets left. I can't purchase anymore with points.",
    "It's actually insane how many people care about your screenshoting technique. Congrats though. Hope I can make to 250 in time.",
    "Ashen goes crazy only when you ult. While Project looks good all the time. If you're just going by looks, I would choose Project.",
    "Meanwhile I main Ark and think he's one of the most fun classes \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Yorick. Different playstyle though. I think Swain has a kinda similar playstyle and build path as Morde though. Both are pretty fun.",
    "Only person on the internet that's helped me. Thank you.",
    "Lmao, I'm pretty sure I remember seeing that post, or either it was one very similar. I remember seeing it and was glad someone else noticed riot's shameful features too. It actually would be in their benefit to make those chroma demos more accurate so people won't think they're shit.\n\nI honestly don't even know anymore when the best time to throw E out. I'm so comfortable with morde, I play him on autopilot and I just know small micro movements that cue for the best time to E. Idk, hard to explain lol.",
    "I almost never bring to because I'm too aggressive of a player and would rather have exhaust or ignite to help me win duels. I also never bring flash, anymore, because ghost is so much better. I do miss flash+q tho a lot.\n\nI used to use conq or grasp, depending what build I wanted to go and who I was fighting, but lately I've been getting AMAZING results with lethal tempo + jaksho. Can build whatever else you want after that. I think it's a common misconception that morde needs conq. Players just need to play around the runes they bring. Morde is a lot more versatile than players give him credit for.",
    "Even if you int pre 6, I feel like you still win at 6. \n\nI don't feel like it's talked about that much, but I always bring ohse rush against kiting champs like Teemo, GP, gnar, etc. It changes everything. You literally just run those champs over. You're sacrificing a little bit of dmg but at the same time you're not because I'm sure you know the value of mobility.",
    "Agreed. Lord is just a nice, cheaper skin.\n\nThat's probably true about his E. I just feel that his E, regardless of the skin, is easy to dodge IF the enemy is looking for it. Similarly, you'll land your E, regardless of the skin, if the enemy isn't looking for it. In ranked, I can understand why those extra smaller details would matter to players.\n\nYea man, high noon is solid. The chromas are too. But I always have to look the chromas up on YouTube because the client's representation of them is impressively bad.",
    "I'm with you! Lethality is fun and all, but I hate being squishy. I've had the most success with only building items with both AD and Health. Spear of Shojin has become a core item for me. I think people are forgetting maiden and ghouls scale off of health too. Yea, the ghouls can be one shot with auto attacks but not everyone can auto them quickly. Also I've seen maiden 1v1 people just because of all the hp it had. It sucks watching a jg just smite all of maiden's hp.",
    "I know he's hated by the world, but Teemo. Pretty sure I've never lost lane against a Teemo as Mordekaiser.\n\nI wanted to say Yuumi, but I'm assuming that doesn't count, lol.",
    "Completely agree with that first paragraph. I was just trying to speak objectively.\n\nWhile Project isn't my favorite, I personally don't think the skin is as clunky and pay to lose as a lot of other people do. I've had no issues or awkward situations with the skin. I only use the skin when I wanna feel really flashy though, haha. I also have this feeling that the skin is so flashy, it gives the impression that I know what I'm doing and makes my opposing laner play worse \ud83d\ude02.\n\nBut I like Lord morde because it just feels right, and high noon because the sound effects are just 10/10 imo",
    "Are you talking about Ashen vs Project? I really don't know what the differences are supposed to be for legendary and mythic skins. I just know that project is a complete change to everything, while Ashen is not.",
    "That's how it should be. I like it when I actually want to rotate between skins. Unlike Pyke, where all of his skins are amazing, but every new skin he gets is easily better than the last. And I feel like I HAVE to use the newest skin, lol. Personal problem though I'm sure.",
    "I was so excited for Ashen, but was kinda underwhelmed by it when it came out. I LOVE the model when he ults, but that's about it. Definitely the best ult model out of all of skins. But in terms of the overall skin, I feel like High Noon, Project, Pentakill 3, and Dark Star are better.",

    "Glad I'm not the only that still uses Lord Mordekaiser. The passive is dope with the lightning in it.",
    "The small gameplay advantages/disadvantages are never enough for me to choose one skin over another. I just don't care that much. I'm definitely picking a skin for the fantasy. Speaking of high noon, I THINK it's my favorite skin at the moment.",
    "Sounds about right :/",
    "Yea, there's a stereotype saying that black people can't swim. Which is true for me, haha",
    "Isn't Infernal's recall the same as base? That ruins a lot of the older skins for me since they don't usually fit the theme.",
    "Coming from a black person, idk why people down voting you. Made sense to me \ud83d\ude02",
    "Same! I would always bring electrocute or dark harvest. But lately, they both feel underwhelming.",
    "Well I'm saying that ashen Knight morde IS Hextech morde since it's the morde skin you obtain with mythic Essence.\n\nOriginally, all mythic Essence skins were 'Hextech skins' since they came out the 'Hextech shop'",
    "Can we get this guy a 'Username of the Year' award? \ud83d\ude02",
    "Olaf: Rush grievous wounds and try to bait out his ult and W before you all-in\n\nGragas: idk but that mfer is annoying as fk to fight. Buddy gets to do his whole combo and walk away before I get to move."
