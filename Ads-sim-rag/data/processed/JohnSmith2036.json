    "There\u2019s no way they could extend it with more episodes. Korra was made on a string budget and it really shows.\u00a0",
    "I think we won\u2019t be getting a fat one because Araki said Valentine looks different because he had an art style overhaul, including one for Valentine. David seems to stick to the art style late in the part thus Valentine will have his late part art style.",
    "The bitrate is much higher on Crunchyroll so if you want the best looking video you should use that. I\u2019m not sure if part 6 is actually available on Crunchyoll, if not you\u2019ll have to settle for Netflix low bitrate.",
    "No, I laugh because it\u2019s a comedic moment that hilariously cuts to a completely different mood playing on the trope of Karin really liking Sasuke to the point she gets off on it.\u00a0",
    "I guess nobody. Never is there a character on screen where I roll my eyes and hope they disappear from the scene. Every character has its narrative use for me.",
    "Don\u2019t worry you don\u2019t have to watch it. You don\u2019t have to be angry about it. I personally love it, slow pacing and everything. Heck I even rewatched it during the 6 month break. But not everything is for everyone. Lots of things don\u2019t click with me that are really popular like JJk or SpyxFamily. Even some cult manga like 20th century boys are a bore to me, but many people love it.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s true it can be frustrating, because you\u2019d rather like it than not right? There\u2019s no benefit to not liking it, but alas it happens sometimes.",
    "Witcher 3, I just don\u2019t get the appeal at all. Also Hades.",
    "Claudia Wolf.\u00a0",
    "This one is easy, I\u2019ll delete both God of War and Mortal Kombat. If I had to limit my power I will absolutely destroy Mortal Kombat.",
    "I never disliked the second half of Death Note and I actually quite like Near.",
    "If the narrative requires it, yes.",
    "Excellent looking.",
    "I think Ellie has the best designed levels for combat and Abby has the best set pieces.",
    "Basically reimaginings. I hate it when all they do is just update graphics. I want them to deviate, rearrange, cut, insert, change the gameplay all preferably with some staff that worked on the original. Examples are Resi 2 remake, FFVII remake\u00a0\n\nExamples of dislikes are spyro, crash, demons souls and the like.",
    "Yes he appears in Black ops 1 and 2 of the ones I have played.",
    "I bring in zero assumptions into a story written by someone else. You only setup yourself for disappointment that way.",
    "Release order so watch it after season 7 and before season 8.",
    "I wish they added anime original content I wish every single adaptation did. But it seems that it is so incredibly frowned upon these days by people that want as many chapters in an episode as possible so most play it safe I suppose. I personally love the anime original stuff that Toei adds to One Piece still, I\u2019m very appreciative of that.",
    "For storytelling purposes.",
    "Her design and that doctors was so silly looking, unlike anything in Naruto, nothing that Kishimoto would draw, which is a shame because I quite like the Anko stuff in this arc. But gosh that fishman design is so silly it ruins the entire thing for me.",
    "It definitely is an above average game and worth playing, but I would\u00a0not be lying that if Fromsoftware had released Lies of P as is, I would be disappointed by its quality. But given the question of OP I would definitely go for Sekiro given the choice between the two.",
    "See you in 3 years for season 3\u2026 if by that point anyone is still interested.",
    "I know, Lies of P clearly apes whatever Fromsoftware does. I don\u2019t know anything about expedition 33 so I would never recommend it as long as I haven\u2019t played it.",
    "Oh this one is easy, play the original not the imitation. That means going for Fromsoftware and thus Sekiro.",
    "Either way Joel couldn\u2019t keep lying. Lying taints the souls, it\u2019s like taking poison.\u00a0",
    "Han, he\u2019s the only jinchuriki to never have any screen time be it filler or canon before or after his resurrection.",
    "You indeed answered your own question in the first sentence.",
    "She is insane and almost killed Claude.",
    "Bro, JJK is the style over substance of its day like Bleach was of its day before it. Don\u2019t read into it too much.",
    "None, I want new games instead.",
    "I personally thought that Joel\u2019s death was a great motivator for the revenge story both for Ellie and Abby. Moreover I don\u2019t find his death disrespectful or anything it\u2019s a story about tragedy after all. I\u2019m also personally a fan that both characters repent, the message that it\u2019s never too late to change the course of your life and do the right thing. Revenge never being the correct answer.",
    "Thanks I\u2019m definitely doing this order next time I play.",
    "The Last of Us Part II, actually I thinks it\u2019s just a small vocal minority in reality that dislikes it but I liked it quite a lot.",
    "Dragon Ball, Naruto, One Piece, Berserk and JOJO. I know it\u2019s a bit generic but those series do give me the most pleasure to read.",
    "If it\u2019s just a disc with nothing on it but a download I won\u2019t buy it anyway.",
    "I imagine he\u2019s seeing the world as 10 juxtapositions for the 10 seconds into the future at all times with epitaph. If he sees himself drop due to a bullet he will remove\u00a0himself from the consequences that would happen in the timeframe he gets shot. So it would just phase through.\n\nNow if you don\u2019t think epitaph works at all times then he\u2019d probably be killed.\u00a0",
    "It\u2019s no use actually jumping into the minutia of techniques on manga because they\u2019re all written to serve one thing: the plot. Stuff is pulled from characters assess whenever necessary. Once you realise that, you also realise there\u2019s very little actual substance and it\u2019s mostly style.",
    "Heather Mason, being a guy I\u2019m happy, at least she\u2019s a woman. Lucky.",
    "Easy bin on mortal kombat, I\u2019d probably play sf6 and sell tekken. MK is definitely getting binned that I am sure of.",
    "My lowest rating apparently is Dragons Dogma and Fairy Tail 2014. Those are just lowest rated, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen worse that I never bothered to log.",
    "Ergo Proxy, Spy x Family, Bleach TYBW, Blue Box, Orb movements of the earth, JJK.\n\nThe reason is always the same, complete and utter boredom on my part while watching.",
    "I personally don\u2019t see the point in bringing in my own assumptions when experiencing a creation of someone else, so I do not.",
    "Absolutely yes for me. I love the anime and manga. But not everything is for everyone, but it seems One Piece is for most due to its popularity. You\u2019ll have to find out yourself.",
    "It\u2019s all up to the individual. For me the anime minus the more egregious filler far exceeds the source material. The plot is the exact same. I personally think there is some brilliant use of voice acting, soundtrack and animation in pivotal moments. Even a lot of the filler in Shippuden is excellent.",
    "The power arc and the six tails vs pain? Although the latter is short. There\u2019s likely more that are not coming to mind right now.\n\nThe Naruto Anime expands on tons of fights that I like though. Lots of the Kakashi vs Obito fight is anime original, and both Naruto and Shippuden do this all the time.",
    "Temari, Ino and Hinata.\n\nIno knows she\u2019s good looking and shows it off, Hinata is shy and covers up, Temari is similar to Shikamaru where things are a pain so her clothes are plain easy to wear.\n\nIn Boruto maybe just Sumire? I don\u2019t read or watch Boruto but I do know she is some sort of scientist character so she has an appropriate outfit except maybe the 20cm heels.",
    "Because the move was thought of as an ace for the Itachi fight narratively speaking. For dramatic purposes kirin was revealed as a wow moment for the Itachi fight and using it before that point would take away from the mystery. You see the real reason is meta instead of in universe.\u00a0",
    "You\u2019re right the actual reason is the idea of tailed beasts and jinchuriki wasn\u2019t thought of by Kishimoto back then, but retroactively I would say the cultures are just different. Some village use the number of tails for their beast name others use the actual name that trickled down from history, just different cultures using different names.",
    "So the version on the cartridge when plugging in on an offline device will just be a native switch 2 version?",
    "So no voucher basically? The version in the cartridge when plugging in on an offline device will just be a native switch 2 version?",
    "From what I gather the switch 2 editions botw and totk and prime 4 have switch 1 cartridges plus some voucher/code for the switch 2 upgrade right?",
    "Dolby Atmos home theatre setup for me.",
    "I\u2019ve been watching since 2011-12 and I\u2019m on 135 days. So seeing you\u2019re days and since 2020 I am a bit prouder in myself.",
    "There\u2019s something really funny to me that an Uchiha with a sharingan requires glasses. I feel like visual jutsu users shouldn\u2019t have glasses.",
    "Do you think a prison would hold Gaara?",
    "Ready?_",
    "Maybe like a 4/10? So below average but not too far lower.",
    "Do people actually care about this kind of power/technique minutia? It just needs to serve the story telling.",
    "Most of the One Piece and Naruto openings, to this day admittedly.\u00a0\n\nMost often happens with long running shows considering I watch the opening and ending every time thus hearing them at least 30 times per season.",
    "The third kept an eye on him even when Naruto was young.\u00a0",
    "Shikamaru, Madara, Kakashi, Naruto and Gaara.\u00a0\n\nI also quite like Obito, Nagato, Naruto\u2019s parents, Neji, Temari\u2026 honestly I like a lot of the characters but Shikamaru is No 1.",
    "It doesn\u2019t look all that interesting. I\u2019ve seen some reviews and am not blown away by it at all as many seem to be. Seems to me it\u2019s mostly style over substance.",
    "To be completely different I honestly don\u2019t see the point of adapting something so closely. And of course be actually well written.",
    "Probably something future maybe cyberpunk but a little more refined than cyberpunk.",
    "I\u2019m really partial to Mewtwo because I like his existential crisis element from the first film. It\u2019s the only Pokemon from what I have seen that actually has \u2018depth\u2019.\u00a0\n\nI also quite like Ralts.",
    "That\u2019s incredibly cute, nice memento.",
    "I thought it was slightly below average so maybe a 4.8/10. The first film I thought was average, the second being fine so 6/10 and the third again average. Just to give context.",
    "Generic?",
    "Really simple. I just am. I think bleach is better than fairy tail but I don\u2019t think too highly of Bleach. I enjoy bleach for the first 200 chapters but then my interest rapidly vanishes.",
    "Versus XIII",
    "Sunset overdrive and ori games and halo 1, 2, 3 (odst) and reach. I don\u2019t care about any other games.",
    "Literally Naruto.\u00a0",
    "Nothing, people just talk in hyperbole these days.\u00a0",
    "1 Hinata\u00a0\n2 Ochaco\n3 Nami\n4 asta noelle\n5 chichi\u00a0\n\nThe rest are whatever don\u2019t care for bleach fairy tail and seven deadly sins",
    "For satisfying narrative sake he was sent to the afterlife. It\u2019s no use trying to overanalyse this stuff taking into account the power/technique minutia etc... Clearly it\u2019s meant to be a sweet farewell where Nagato leaves this realm and confidently leaves Naruto to deal with saving the world.",
    "The devs probably knew that Xbox crowd wouldn\u2019t buy this game in large numbers and probably weighed it against Xbox just giving them a sum up front and found that the sum was probably more than what they would get from actual sales.",
    "I have been disappointed so far. I really put in effort every week when watching but I can\u2019t bring myself to care as much as I did for season 1 and 2. But I\u2019m giving it a chance.",
    "I prefer 3, think 4 is downright ugly, 5 is fine.",
    "She was a stage actress for a One Piece show by no means a cosplayer. I doubt she has cosplayed outside of it being job related ever.\u00a0",
    "Mediocre.",
    "I thought it was just ok. I found it mostly boring until the ending. It feels to me for a long stretch of it style over substance. I do like that it\u2019s the bible he\u2019s protecting but I can\u2019t imagine specifically the bible to go missing after a war considering it\u2019s distributed so much often for free.",
    "Tryhard/10.",
    "I had the same thought. When he went stage 2 in the episode 3 I was like nothing happend yet.\n\nAnime feels very stilted and poorly directed.\u00a0",
    "I literally just use the site to know which episode I watched last. I\u2019m don\u2019t doing any of the behaviour this guys video is describing.",
    "I watched around 14\u00a0episodes but I can\u2019t quite see the quality others are seeing. I don\u2019t feel any ambition from a directorial standpoint. It\u2019s decently animated but the \u2018camerawork\u2019 is quite standard and uninteresting. I kind of like the story motif of an idea (heliocentrism) propagating through people into the future but the characters to me felt so stiff and uninspiring and we spend so little time with them when they go it\u2019s difficult for me to care so I dropped it.",
    "The real answer is as strong as the plot needs it to be.",
    "Wow easiest choice ever, Gurren lagann.",
    "I think a lot of people have a hard time with him because they hit his legs and arms. Really a lot of his attacks end with his head front and center and that\u2019s key. You gotta hit is head and the fight is over much quicker. He staggers like crazy from hitting his head too.",
    "Japan PS2",
    "Not really, what\u2019s the greater message the author wants to convey about his characters in this prologue? We don\u2019t get much in terms of character ambitions other than the bare minimum. I like it don\u2019t get me wrong but it\u2019s more a fine rather than good.",
    "While I like Black Lagoon it doesn\u2019t have as much staying power in my mind. But you\u2019re right with your probability.",
    "Pirates",
    "Top right, Ichigo and Boruto\n\nEasiest decsision ever.",
    "I guess it\u2019s good seeing Takahiro Sakurai. I really didn\u2019t want his voice work be replaced in anime so I\u2019m guessing all that business is behind us.",
    "I quite enjoyed it including the ending.\u00a0",
    "I only recruit human pawns.",
    "Not everything I\u2019m definitely getting rid of bleach some day.",
    "He is a giant. The designs in Dark souls 2 are largely ignored in 3. Instead 3 is a sequel more to 1. Yeah there\u2019s the single re used asset in dark souls 3 to get seeds from but I wouldn\u2019t read into it that much regarding lore. 2 is just the odd one out.",
    "Dandadan itself already feels a bit like a spin-off.",
    "I like 1 and 3. I remember being incredibly disappointed when 2 came out.\u00a0",
    "Definitely Bleach, JJK and AoT from the ones you listed. Other examples I can think of are Sakamoto Days, One Punch Man, Vinland Saga and Solo Leveling.",
    "Might not be enough seeders? I\u2019m not sure what website you\u2019re using to get your torrent though.",
    "Probably. I\u2019m not sure what happend with Pierrot but they seem to have lost the talent and funding to make weekly anime. From what I gather Pierrot is semi recovering from some financial troubles. They are a shell of what they used to be.\u00a0",
    "Do these master editions still have the cover volumes somewhere included? Seems like such a waste to just omit those.",
    "Dragon Ball",
    "Did you start watching anime around 2013?",
    "They\u2019re still happy and not miserable?",
    "I\u2019ve only played 1-3, Shattered Memories and will play f. Never cared for the others.",
    "Imagine Kishimoto actually using the panelling and the medium of books to his strength by having Itachi point to the left for you to flip the page and there he is sitting. It\u2019s so incredibly rare in manga when the act of reading a book and excellent panelling is combined.",
    "No, pure coincidence.",
    "Have fun, go in blind, experience it for yourself.",
    "It\u2019s called character design, it\u2019s to make clear to the viewer that they are indeed hashirama cells.\u00a0",
    "I can\u2019t really get into the manga, maybe I\u2019ll put it on hold until season 2 is over.",
    "Thanks that\u2019s good to know. I really hope it kicks in before the season ends.",
    "I\u2019m an anime only, the animation is not the turn off for me. It\u2019s the lack of plot.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t put too much faith into these sorts of diagrams. Most of the time they are meaningless narratively.",
    "Not the OP but this does sounds like the narrative will get a little more interesting in the coming episodes. Thanks for telling me.",
    "I will definitely bring up this point in class, thank you very much!"
