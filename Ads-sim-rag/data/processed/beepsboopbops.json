    "Bruh. You income is 4100 and you're broke? I take home around 2k a month, and I always have some cash left over. I think the thing that's kicking your ass the most is the alcohol and gambling. Get some help for that, and try buying not ss expensive weed. Don't gotta get the top shelf shit just because the numbers are higher.",
    "Just use fresh water, not salt water, and you're fine.",
    "I don't have lucid dreams, but I have really realistic ones. They usually involve me working with someone and someone else trying to screw it up.",
    "I guess if the temp is more than 130 it's medium, but I'd still eat it. It looks perfectly fine.",
    "Oh my dear little 8 pound 6 ounce baby Jesus.\nBreak up with this assclown. He's showing you how he really is. Being sick in any way doesn't make it okay to treat people like that. Let alone someone you're supposed to care about. Get out while you still can.",
    "Kate's mom in hawkeye.",

    "*for the record I am an atheist, hut there are a lot of religious nut jobs.*\n\nSince I'm assuming it will be translated for everyone, and not just broadcast in English, I would say this:\n\n\"This is the Voice of God.\n\nYou are all My children\u2014equal, sacred, and beloved.\n\nI did not create you to divide yourselves by color, creed, or coin. I did not gift you this world so you could poison it with hate or hoard its bounty while your brothers and sisters suffer.\n\nEnd racism. End greed. Help each other. Love one another as I have loved you.\n\nIf you choose selfishness over compassion, cruelty over kindness, you will bring upon yourselves a sorrow no miracle will mend. The end will not be of My doing\u2014but of your own hands.\n\nYou still have time.\n\nChange now.\"",

    "Is this the same guy that got happy GTA 6 was gonna have pride parades so he can go destroy it? Seems like a MAGA die hard to me. This is all just posturing for sympathy (from other white people) they don't actually care.",
    "All I do is go to work, come home go to bed and repeat. Sometimes on weekends I'd take my adopted (like we met as friends and got closer) sisters kids out to try a new restaurant. I'm pretty sure the clone could do that just fine. As far as impulsive actions, the worst I do is buy too many snacks every once in a while.\n\nTl;Dr I'll take the free 10 billion, and in a year, my adopted family will never have to worry about money again.",
    "I know how to cook meat. Therefore I can be at least friendly with Luffy, so I got some Hella protection. I can train to get stronger/use haki and possibly get a devil fruit power. I'd be okay I think.",

    "If he's talking he's lying. But he'll tell you he's not ecause he's not smart enough to know what he's talking about and he believes everything he says.",

    "All those asshole just dumping trash up there. Fuck everybody in that video except for the sherpas.",
    "I would issue an executive order saying no felons can be president, fire everybody that he appointed, Including JD Vance. Then I would voluntarily turn myself over to capitol police for inciting an insurrection. Then wait for 10 days.",
    "Does the super intelligence also come with enhanced processing/reaction time? If not, I'd say luck.",
    "Does this also change when you move? Or is it your place of residence?",
    "Just put an article for impeachement against him every day. You could do a different one for each of his first 100 days. Eventually there will be a breaking point.",

    "I also enjoy Nickelback, OP. You're not the only one. Animals is a banger.",
    "Sure. I'm a straight, able bodied, former military 38 year old male. I'd be fine. In any of those eras.",
    "I do absolutely nothing. I wouldn't be worried if every woman got superpowers. If anything it would make the world a better place. Women could be who they want without worrying about being killed by a man. Shitty men would have to rectify their ways or be dealt with. There are women in just about every possible work field, so there would probably not be much changes for decent men. Just continue to be a decent guy and you'd be fine.",

    "My veins don't blow out, but every time I've gotten blood drawn, I always tell them to go for the vein in my left arm in the crook of my elbow because it's huge and visible damn near 100% of the time. When I was in the military, they didn't listen to me and tried to get it in my right arm like 2 or 3 times, then switched to the left and got it straight away, in the vein I told them. I just look at them and say \"see?\"",
    "Tell her you'll give her a loan, but only if you both agree to get it notarized, and woth a 150% interest rate that compounds daily.",

    "Nothing signifies a growing country like small businesses not being able to survive!",
    "Minecraft",
    "He's not wrong. We need to get the corrupt criminals out of the country. Idk why he's still here though. You'd think someone with 34 felony convictions would be at the top of the list.",
    "Having a fully functional vrain and able to admit when you're wrong. That's the only thing that will make them accept the situation, but you see how it works out every day.",
    "Sure I'd ho back to my early 20s and take advantage of the offer of bitcoin for $0.20 buy $20 and hold it. That way both versions of me come out with money at the end.",

    "Never thought to make dice bags. Fantastic idea!",
    "Yes. Captain hammer.",
    "Doom hands down. He's the only one e that's content with just ruling his country the best way for his citizens. Most of the time Doom is fighting someone because they did something to Latveria. I'd much rather have a president that would go fuck up other superpowers himself instead of sending poor peoples kids to fight and die.",
    "Since mind domination is so broken and doesn't require you to be in the same space as the other person, I'll choose that one, and change all billionaires minds to be very altruistic and change Republicans to be empathetic and despise Donald Trump. I would make every person in the US despise Donald Trump and his cronies. I would not change Donald Trumps mind, other than to dial up his empathy and sense of guilt the highest they could possibly go. I'd change Elon musk to hate Nazis and Nazism. For starters.",
    "This isn't writing. It's just scribbles to see what kind of shit people will say about it.",
    "I enjoy seeing them post shit like this because there's absolutely 0% chance Donald Trump will ever read them. Even if he got the notification, he won't read it. He probably wouldn't be able to read/comprehend theoverwhel.ing majority of the post anyways because he can't read.",
    "Liminal",
    "Snap cleaning. I'm terrible at remembering to clean stuff. But if I could just snap? Gimme. \nNeed a shower? Snap.\nBrush teeth? Snap.\nA bidet? Snap.\nCats litter box? Snap.\nLiterally my life would be 100x better.",
    "What if I asked the genie to take it out of someone specifically? Like take $50 million from Jeff Bezos, or Elon Musk or The like. Don't care to empty their account, but I would like to see them be $50 million less for no real reason.",
    "A hulking behemoth",
    "If I was in a zombie apocalypse, I'd run up onto of a roof where I could take supplies. I'd also take my slingshot and a few rocks, glass objects or fire crackers. If they were taking too long to leave my area, I'd use the small ammo in my slingshot to distract them towards an area the opposite way I'd intend to run/travel.",
    "Because they intrinsically know more about the human body and what it takes to heal/what is wrong.",
    "Gravity, illusion, monk",
    "Then you would receive the healing factor. Obviously not as effective as the people qith increased intelligence as well, but you still heal faster than \"normal\"",
    "It took me 1.25 seconds to say the phrase \"Santa isn't real.\" I could say that phrase something like 2700 times an hour, giving myself time to breath and take a drink or something. 2700 x 5 =$13,500/hr. I'll do this as my new full time job.\n$108,000 per 8 hour shift, $540,000 per week, say %30 in taxes, that gives me $378,000 per week take home. 52 weeks per year is $19,656,000. Thanks for the easy street life.",
    "Enhanced intelligence and/or a healing factor",
    "Just what we need a druish princess.",
    "Free Guy. They didn't need to cram the last second love story crap.",
    "Time, space, chaos.",
    "Just loudly say, \"Hey! Here you go.\" Before you lightly toss it to them. Still technically throwing at them, and they'll either catch it or dodge it. Either way, $50.",
    "Absolutely! I wouldn't just do that. I'd work on eliminating world hunger. And for sure do some shit to fix homelessness.",
    "Because it wasn't CGI most of the dinos were practical effects.",
    "Leave yesterday.",
    "Sometimes I just go to the anomaly to give away salvaged data. I can't not dig something up if it's near me, and there have been times where I've had 60+ salvaged data, and I have everything unlocked so they're literally useless to me other than credits (which I have literally billions of). So I ho to the anomaly to unload all my extra stuff. I try to do it on the weekends so there are more players in the anomaly than otherwise.",
    "Extremely precise gravity manipulation. They're flying at me, I put a micro black hole inside their head. Or increase gravity by 4000x and squish their head/other body parts like a bug.",
    "Hey, run for president.",
    "Too bad empty land mass can't vote, huh?",
    "That you like chicken, I guess.",

    "I want this guy back. Come back to us, Barry! We need you!",
    "Honestly, the differences in the animals. There are animals in the video that I've never seen. I usually get the same 4-10 animals on any/every planet I visit. The teddybear looking guys, the cats with 6 legs, and the fat quadriped are the most prevalent. Changing the head or just the ears on the body doesn't really make it a different animal. Not different enough to qualify it being on the same planet 4 different times with different ears.",
    "Also in support.",
    "Just specifically call that person out as a sponsor. Gush over them supporting your channel and just be willfully ignorant of his comments. Like if they say, \"your channel is trash!\" Just be like, \"Thanks for watching g all my videos, subscribing and commenting. It really helps out the channel!\"",
    "Haha! Oh wait, he's serious. Let me laugh harder. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!",
    "10 years? We're lucky if the US survived this administration.",
    "According to his own words, empathy is a sin/weakness. So why would we have empathy for that assclown?",
    "Fucking duh. Every non-right voter told them this shit. Nobody is surprised but them. They voted red, they're getting what they voted for. They just thought it was going to happen to other people.",
    "Because idiots think democracy = democrats, and republic = republicans. And there are a LOT of idiots in the U.S.",
    "I work in food production. I have to wash my hands like 30 times a day.",
    "Fuck those guys. The only shit I would give you would be like, \"did you bring me any today?\" Obviously in a joking manner, but I wouldn't talk shit because your wife makes you bomb ass lunches. Those other dudes are just jealous and they make themselves feel better by talking shit about your happiness. Fuck 'em.",
    "Your feelings toward sex are completely valid. Some people don't want to have sex. Some wait until they're for sure ready. Some want to do it all the time. There's nothing wrong with any of them, they're just different when it comes to sex.\nIn my opinion, if you ask once, it's consent. Ask more than once, or really often, or are pushy about whatever the thing is, it's coercion. Don't be afraid to be alone. I'd rather be alone and feel happy/safe than to be with the wrong company and feel unhappy/unsafe with them. Just some food for thought.",
    "It probably actually just hit the curb from a too tight turn.",
    "One billion dollars, and my life doesn't change? Fuckin sign me up! I'll show these billionaires how to change the world for good.",
    "I would let them hang out for a while. We'd go get some food, and I'd answer any questions amd ask all the questions that I would inevitably have regarding who their mother was, how I was when their version of me died and if they knew how to travel back/to another dimension/universe. Just because I'm childless in this universe doesn't mean I'm a monster with no empathy. They either tore a hole in the fabric of space and time, invented brand new, fantastic texhnology; or have some form of magic available to them. In any case, they went through a lot of time/enwrgy/resources to come see me, so the least I would do is spend a bit of time with them.",
    "When he gets drunk, start offering to pay for stuff. See what he does when you show hard and fast that you don't need his money. Fuck him. Literally a personification of why America is fucked up right now. People woth money to throw around thinking they can do whatever because they're rich.",
    "Fuck, I hope nobody shows up to that.",
    "I'll do the phonetic alphabet. Easy 260k",
    "Because if there's a bigger yard, there's less space for more houses for a stupidly inflated price.",
    "Increase the fine 25% every month.",
    "Because it's predominantly far right-wing douche canoes that still use Twitter, so the algorithm doesn't have any nonfascist shit to push to people.",
    "Oh FUCK no. I would have yelled at her for saying pro-nazi shit and walked the fuck out.",
    "Sure. I'd dress up as Tarzan when they first found him.",
    "Stop linking back to X.",
    "The knife. That whip sword is not battle ready, nor would it last against more than one zombie. The knife would be usable more than once. That \"sword\" looks like it would get caught on something and break the first time you use it. Not to mention that it takes some bit of k owledge/skill to use that \"sword\" but most people already know the basics of how to ise/fight with a knife.",
    "Orphan crushing machine.",
    "Billy Oates.",
    "This dude is the cringes edge lord I've ever seen. He's emotionally/mentally immature. He behaves like he's 12 years old. Dude needs to go bankrupt and fade I to oblivion already.",
    "Johnny Spells",
    "Most religions I the world believe in some form of reincarnation. Even early Christianity believed in reincarnation up until 553 AD where they changed it to use Christianity as a tool for control.",
    "Onions.",
    "Gravity, space, 1911",
    "Racists, fascists, and people who are only concerned with their own money and getting more of it no matter what.\nI'll gladly pay $1 million for that.",
    "Sure why not.  Not any better or worse than my real name.",
    "Don't join a HOA. You WILL regret it. They own your house, not you. Fuck HOAs. Nothing but power tripping assholes.",
    "Hmmm... mom of 4... each family member added a pic... there should be at most 6 pictures. Either you can't count, or you're lying. Or both.",
    "Left is crocodile, right is more dinosaur/large lizard.",
    "Telling someone you've never met that they have kind eyes, then everytime you see that person, commenting something similar. Same way creepy guys latch on to one specific thing about a girl and always mention it when they see them.",
    "Try looking up milled veg tan. It's still veg tan so you can dye it how you please, but it's more malleable than regular veg tan.",
    "They're pushing back like it's a finger at an orgy. They are the literal living version of the \"oppress me harder\" memes.",
    "Signed!",
    "I'm a USMC veteran, and I don't feel betrayed. Probably because I had the common fucking decency to not vote for mango mussolini. I'm angry and sad and scared how this shit is going down. It feels like my time in the service was pointless. Motherfuckers elected a fascist, and are now surprised he's doing fascist shit.",
    "Yeah, $81 for an oil change is pretty standard fare, unless they're using shitty oil like pennzoil or something. The rest shouldn't be done/have been done u less you specifically okayed them to do it. You can deny getting the other stuff done. It's a business.  They're gonna try to get you to get extra services everytime you go in there. Most \"quick-lube\" places usually have a certain daily/weekly/monthly quota for how much their average sale is. I know because I used to work for Valvoline Instant Oil Change. I quit once I saw the invoice sheets and the mark up of up to 1000% on shit. My conscience couldn't take it.",
    "Cheap-o wallets from Walmart are technically made with \"genuine leather\" as well. It's just the thinnest, cheapest stuff they can possibly get. Like not even 1oz leather. But since it's technically real leather, they can say it. Just like saying stuff with a shit load of artificial sweeteners and stuff can say it's zero sugar, even though they're using sugar alcohols.",
    "At this point they're jumping into the leopards mouths and complaining the anti-LAMF would have pushed them if they didn't.",
    "The one that's playing, I suppose.",
    "My favorite is Ronald McDumpypants.",
    "Kamen rider? Is that you?",
    "Everyone is saying that because it's true.",
    "It's almost guaranteed to be a mixed breed of some sort. Strays don't usually come in pure bred.",
    "At least he's using it?",
    "Minimum wage was supposed to be the minimum wage to afford a life. Not the minimum allowed by law. It makes me fucking irate when people don't understand that.",
    "Hey, you're doing really well for only your second wallet. Clean cut lines, solid stitching and a desire to improve. You're doing great and will only get better.",
    "I would cure one stage 4 for the $10 mil, then give all the other money I get from curing whomever to them. They probably have Hella hospital bills.",
    "Fair enough. Like I said I was just curious. Fwiw, it would probably fold easier if it wasn't stitched.",
    "Nice looks better stitched for sure! Just a quick question, why did you sew the single layer? Like the bit in the fold in the middle. This is just me nitpicking, not criticizing, but I would have only done around the pockets. It would make the interior look neater.",
    "Ummm... I bought my first video game in 1.5 years yesterday. But probably food delivery and/or leatherworking supplies is the truest answer.",
    "If one has $450 billion, one clearly exploited one's workers and didn't care who one harmed on one's way up. So probably if one had $450 billion dollars, yes one would probably want more because that's the type of personality it takes for one to accumulate so much in the first place.",
    "Kevin Smith - I went to a dinner at a friend's house and Kevin Smith was there. Got to hang out, smoke weed and talk comics with him. He's super smart and really funny.\n\nGiancarlo Esposito - I met him at a Comic Con, and had at least 15 minutes just talking about his suits and hats (made by my friend John Penman.)\n\nDanny Trejo - he came to my booth at a Comic Con and hung out for like 15 - 20 minutes talking with people and taking pictures.\n\nKeith David - also at a Comic Con, he came by our booth, charmed everyone with his smooth-as-silk voice, and signed some stuff. Very nice, charming man.\n\nI mean, those are the super big stars, but I've met Catherine Tate, Temuera Morrison, Emily Swallow, Jason Mewes, John Delancey, Brent Spiner, Dee Bradley Baker, and a while bunch of others. If you have the chance, go to Comic Cons!",
    "Batman vs. Luffy. I think anything past gear 2 would be over kill. Luffy is FTL at that point.",
    "The rest of the world.  It makes a huge difference to how you see and treat people.",

    "Let him leave. He doesn't want to do it anymore. If you had a hobby, then one day didn't like it anymore, but you were made to keep doing it, how would you feel?",
    "Well considering it's not illegal to protest on colleges, everyone should be okay.",
    "When did the 11 year old from stranger things turn 40?",
    "I wouldn't get a big dog or something with a lot of energy of any size. Like no husky or jack Russell or boxer. Maybe a small dog like a chihuahua or something.",
    "I bet your neighbor voted for trump.",
    "Oh no! Exactly what I voted for happened! I only wanted this to happen to other people! Give me sympathy guys!",
    "FDT by YG.\npart one and 2, but pt 2 is better imho",
    "If you're still making payments, you're still supporting nazis.",
    "Yes. It's much too old. I went out on a date at a rage room with someone once, and it turns out they were 19. As soon as I found that out, it was like I was playing with one of my nieces/nephews. I felt gross for not knowing it before hand. But we met at a comic con. I told them straight up that I was way too old for them, but we could be friends. And that's how it stayed. Any 25+ yo actively pursuing a 18-19 yo is a predator or at least an untrustworthy individual."
