    "Try outbreak manipulation. Using lvl2 encounter shop food or sandwich (does NOT require herbal mystica) and your location you can increase your chances of spawning desired outbreak. Watch this video by Austin John:\nhttps://youtu.be/53YjaF5dHDc?si=zFVwhEej4B6PEgY1",
    "Are we playing different games? There ARE Eevee outbrakes (but rare and in bad spots), there was an event with shiny boosted Eevee. I've got about a dozen of them shinies including one JUMBO that I've decided, don't need to be evolved.\n Most of those wish lists include hard to come by but plausible outbreaks.",
    "The Legend, The GOAT!\nTututututututututututuuuuuuuu",
    "Buuuurn",
    "Apparently if you go to anime fan stores in Japan, you will most likely see a WHOLE SECTION dedicated to just REM, as big as a section for Re:Zero.",
    "Hello darkness my old friend.... One of the nightmare shiny hunts for me, not only them bulls are charging at you (heavens forbid mentioning veluza hunt), but shiny is hard to see due to being subtle and game light doesn't help.",
    "I can feel the doubt through the screen",
    "Yup yup! There are outbrakes that has ONLY Rockruffs with 'own tempo' (that transform into dusk form)",
    "Now I'm trying to do the same but with shinies. 12 boxes of shinies in... Easier ones sorted already",
    "Glad you were able to pull him out",
    "I feel happy for you, yet I can't help but hate you a little...",
    "You beat me to it, this song lives rent free in my brain![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)",
    "That is ..... MEOWDORABLE!",
    "I didn't want to make a long post so:\nPart 2. FALSE SWIPE is a must have. It lowers health but no matter what will leave 1hp but won't work on ghosts as it's Normal type move. Also beware pokemon with takedown or memento as they are self damaging moves and your catch had 1helth left just a second ago.\nStatus conditions raise the chance of capturing, but there're only 2 non damaging options- sleep and paralyze. Sleep is better out of 2 so you need hypnosis or spore move (later won't work on grass type tho). \nClassic choices for hunting that have those 2 are Gallade or Breloom ( he needs to be evolved past lvl40 to have spore from shroomish). If you have access to the Violet version get Iron Valiant.\nTo deal with those ghost and grass types you can use move soak to make them water type.",
    "Quick tips then, SAVE BEFORE ENCOUNTER. If you want to catch something badly, QUICK BALL it before you do ANYTHING ELSE. 80% of the time it stays in but only on 1st move. If it breaks out try another high chance ball. Of course if you want it in a specific ball then you need to fight it.",
    "https://youtu.be/xE00c-Y2K-g?si=Cl02G-QsXTM8lCZD",
    "It's the smallest pond near the fellhorn gorge( East part of kitakami). If you have trouble finding it just search YouTube for \"shiny lvl100 Magikarp hunt\". Good luck have fun!",
    "Hi, millennial question, wtf is aura?",
    "There's a spot in kitakami, where lvl 100 magikarp spawns. It can be shiny. Also some outbrakes replace spawns there so other pokemon can have lvl 100 shiny spawns there",
    "Sure, all them feeders love that spell. Rarely I see it being used for good reasons, but it's useful for SOME people...",
    "Ah I see you've acquired the secret of LIGMA!\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/Sjhpz5NTkxs?si=Ap1-z5x_EXkaYQUi",
    "Wow awesome, I've never encountered shiny in raid and I've got 11 tabs of shinies",
    "Nyatsuga tenyan\n\n![gif](giphy|mtP2XgflmwyRy)\n\nGif for those who remember bakemonogatari [https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/s/s1PB1D7m8S](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/s/s1PB1D7m8S)",
    "Exactly, for those who don't know: it's like a panther is just black coat jaguar and leopards. That's just like real world shiny. This glitch did us a favor.",
    " I just can't convince myself to hunt for a 'family of three'. I've got 1 shiny tandemouse and that's enough",
    "Sometimes you can trigger a battle with a wall-stuck mons, BUT ONLY IF they are AGGRESSIVE type and charge at you on sight.",
    "The best inventors and engineers are pragmatic-lazy in this way.",
    "A teacher in my highschool told me once, that there are different types of laziness. Some are straight up LAZY to the point of being useless. But then there's PRAGMATIC LAZY, these people are lazy but intelligent enough to see that the problem won't disappear on its own. They find the best easiest solution to solve anything they face with minimum time/energy/resources spent and do it so it would not bother them later. I think it's a great simple example of how it works.",
    "Any heavy CC, once she can't reach or hit you, her entire toolkit melts away. For exp Lane? Just don't push her early and play your game. If you are too far from the turret she will punish you but if she pushes too far into your turret you can punish her. In general play safe and catch her off guard in groups. She isn't that scary in TFs",
    "Quick ball all day, better safe than sorry, and faster than later. Unless it's a specific shiny, then I would need to draw you a very confusing diagram",
    "Ah you must be Angela main",
    "I would suggest naming after the dances they represent, or places that you associate with those dances. But it might be a bit problematic with some forms like cheerleading or Japanese dance.\nSo maybe a combination of sorts:\n-Flamenco / Andalusia, it's the easiest one, both sounds good as nemes.\n-Hula / Hawaii, these are too simplistic so maybe refer to main styles of hula, 'kahiko being ancient form and modern is \u02bbauana.\n-This is difficult. For Japanese dance (Nihon-buy\u014d) I propose  Kabuki/Edo, but you may also use two main groups of these dances, Mai and Odori.\n-Cheerleading/'Murica, this one is hardest and doesn't sound good, so maybe... first women cheerleading were from *Minnesota*, pom-pom was invented in *Texas* state, but mine preferred choice is name Courtney because they perform on court? It's hard one.",
    "Inception, and I'm Nolan's fan, huge respect to DiCaprio, but this movie doesn't click with me...",
    "Norman, because Garchomp's shiny looks the same as NORMAL one",
    "I live in the UK and I'm keeping distance from any actual British food, it's VILE under flavored since they can't stand any spices or herbs. Don't even get me started on English breakfast, hate the consistency of beans and bacon that's so under cooked that it's cheesy instead of crispy and salty.",
    "A kid who thought he could afford something there beside Minifigures",
    "Sorry but it looks like the wall is intentionally made so it looked like poorly made to hide well fitted doors.\n\nLook at the last frames of video, and the wall is at best MEH, while focusing on doors makes video awesome.\n\nYeah, cool doors tho, respect",
    "https://preview.redd.it/m16woig3nrhd1.jpeg?width=2412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0f8cb2af0f0f13cd521d851d38e38ca4216fa40\n\nIt's SICK AF",
    "Wait, what? Where is it? Julie has only a base, basic, and JJK skins",
    "Why does she look like Natalie Portman? Is it just me?",
    "Franco, in our team he takes up a hero slot. The end. Nothing useful comes from his existence... misses all the hooks, can't tank, can't push, ults enemy ONLY while alone SPECIFICLY.\n\nYet somehow there's a slither of chance that the enemy Franco will run the aimbot and gank you whenever u want to check bushes, together with the enemy assassin.",
    "You like to rub bellies. No doubt",
    "Highly underrated one of my favorite moments in the series, as well as in the anime ever, period.",
    "I cut my butter, honestly no jokes. Keep it in the fridge, take it out, make a thin slice and put it on bread. You can use vegetable peelers to cut it if you want or have your knife warm a bit before cutting.",
    "RIP to his wrist",
    "If you'll ever use these for a BBQ do not let that touch flame. My friend wiped his fingers with tissue, he had only a few drops on his food, then threw that tissue into flames. \n\nFumes worked exactly like pepper spray and since it was a hot day with no wind it persisted there for a while.",
    "Depending on where you come from I would find a relatable comparison. \nIn general it's on the same level as spicy takeaway food (excluding the likes of McDonald's or KFC which have \"spicy\" only in names to avoid being sued by morons).\nRather mild not much flavor in general although some like it.\nIf you're afraid of testing ANY spicy sauce, before testing have yoghurt and chocolate bar prepared in advance, as they negate pain in your mouth very well.\nDO NOT try to wash it off with water as it will just amplify sensation.",
    "Rowlet for the style.\nSimply all comes down to your preference.\nI think both of them have access to false swipes which is essential. Moveset wise I would say that grass starter have more coverage when it comes to types of hisui pokemon, which has only few fire ones so you don't need water type that much.\n\nYou can find a decent replacement for the water starter more easily in my opinion. Even if you want to have starters of both types, when you unlock swimming on the 3rd map you'll have access to piplup there as well as turtwig in the marsh area.",
    "I've got a shiny 0 IV beldum named 'scrap zero'\n\nHow do you even call this? Shiny nundo... Shnundo?",
    "Wow, that's rare, never seen shiny in raid\n\nI believe nothing affects their odds. Like nothing, not even a shiny charm.",
    "Guilty crown, seraph of end and surprisingly promised Neverland. The list might be longer but I can't remember the titles.",
    "Sure, it was a surprise, but I've got one and right next to Gardevoir outbreak. Anihilape shows up only at night BTW. Also in the dark it's crazy hard to see which is shiny. I gave up. If you wish to save it for longer manually change the clock to midnight the SAME DAY with game TURNED OFF. Then turn the game on and you have outbreak for longer.",
    "Like scratch you, also aside from air/vacuum/liquid movement is limited by nails",
    "I blame these long fingernails. Makes you wonder how fragile the toilet paper is...",
    "Sounds like opening scene of some shit isekai anime",
    "Thank you mate!",
    "How do I even get screenshots from Nintendo into mobile?",
    "Upvote for Jojo reference",
    "Therese a cave near cortodondo (psychic gym)\nNot the main big one, if you go west then jump down to the coast in the area that looks like blue and yellow eye on the map. Cave is small but can spawn salandit and salazzle. Shiny sandwich for fire or poison and some panience and you have decent chances",
    "Please go with Vaporeon [stored power, calm mind, toxic armor and aqua ring] \nmodest nature, water absorption ability, 252hp and sp.atck and as held item covert cloak to avoid poison from gunk shot.\n\nAfter 3 turns it will clear stat changes on you, so \"hang in there\" cheer set up aqua ring and spend 3rd for whatevs. Then 3times toxic armor> 6 calm minds> all out cheer. Boss will have shield and do some double teams but it takes 3 hits of store power to kill.\n\nIf you do it online with others and they have Vaporeons already, get some support mons, I had good time with toxapex but try others by yourself.\n Good luck",

    "The truth is Larry.",
    "Why do I never listen to warnings",
    "My question is, will women going to be allowed there? I've asked google:\n\nQatar Beaches Bikini Rules\nYou absolutely can not wear a bikini at a public beach in Qatar and you can not wear a one piece either as it reveals too much flesh. Men also have to be careful in their swim attire as they would also need to cover their knees and wear a rash vest.\n\nUuum, come right in tourists?",
    "Wait isn't it supposed to be kid friendly game? Now they are doing \"diamond dust\" to celebrate something. I mean deadlines must be rough but I hope they'll escape this nasty addiction XD",
    "I thought it was chestnuts, mind blown",
    "That was my second, I had big shark submarine as well later. Minifig in this one had cool beard, he was my favorite for years, although he looks kinda evil",
    "It's at least year old video, saw it on WhatsApp. Yh UK it was supposedly in Birmingham or west midlands",
    "Please if you read this comment be aware, my cousins cat was fascinated by fake tree and over night ate tons of plastic needles. Ha had to have operation... and not a nice one, make sure Gwen won't do the same mistake",
    "Well said, the whole lift looks like a joke, looks like guy somehow lifted the weight with different angle so he thought he could do declaim ... I've seen guy who got his scalp peeled off a bit, with similar accident. Ever since I'm skipping gym and sticking to calisthenics",
    "He just said it's Legal and there's no telling if it's \"legit\" whatever this means. If legit means you've caught it or your good mate and willingly gave it away to you, therefore you're TRYHARD that only collect those... then sure delete it. For me it's as LEGAL AND LEGIT as it needs. Stats normal? No weird moves? No unchangeable name/OG trainer name of some dodgy site? GOOD TAKE IT.\n\nNow that cool emoji from your comment symbolizes blindness",
    "I simply keep butter block in fridge and then cut it into thin slices carefully. After a while spreading butter feels wrong, and the result are unsatisfying or un-even.",
    "Since you though it might be a bobcat I recon it's only way to suggest, to call it **Boby or Tom** if it's him, and **Lynx or Queen** if it's her.",
    "Most importantly bobcats have short tails, like you can tell the difference even if they are few days old",
    "Change his name bro, it's name suited for pig at best, and nasty one only",
    "Why posh people say bri'ish instead of British? What happened with the \"T\"?\n.\n.\n.\n.... They drank it all...",
    "Basically most evil invention in British arsenal. Tasteless, somehow popular, and makes you feel heavy in the stomach from the start of the day. Full English they call it...",
    "Oblivious about the fact that dogs tend to do exactly this behavior in particularly stinky places, preferably own or other dogs poop?",
    "Not only metaphorically, isn't it one of these breeds with wildcat blood?",
    "Looks a bit like Ori from game series. Specially from blind forest cover",
    "As a flu medicine. Seriously this thing is lethal, freaking strong, just sniff and enjoy your nostrils being cleaned out of all bacteria or viruses\nSeriously with this I don't even know why we had COVID in UK",
    "I understand you, also big fan of cat mojo man, but again Jason mostly deal with misbehaving house cats, not a STRAYS (unless we talk about game, then he has video on yt playing). Kittens learn from their mother how to interact with humans. Most likely kitty has spent all his short life avoiding us at all cost. These don't come out to smell you like a house cat, they tremble and run away from us.\nI've rescued plenty of kittens in the past to see this one might be though nut.\nI hope it's not one of these, and can be tamed easily.",
    "Bro I feel you! Carnivine or aipom in my case, and I hate aipom.",
    "It's STRAY they avoid people, you can't just pet it.\nIt doesn't want to smell you or come near you.\nWe had one like that in the backyard a few years ago and it took me and my family over a month to PET him.\nToo much HtTYD?",
    "Yh I see a lot of \"food\" comments but no one mention biggest mistake beginners do - eye contact! DO NOT STARE! Yes it sounds weird because it's little creature and it's cute, but it's BAD sign for feral cat.\n\nSit down nearby put food far away from you and face other direction, possibly doing LONG BLINKS like 2 seconds long. NOT LOOKING is the sign of TRUST for cats.",
    "Same pref here, two ridiculously inteligent man one with tech to keep me safe one with mystic arts who can vingardium leviosa and avada kadavra them out of there",
    "Really jealous of cleavor, can't get it no matter what....",
    "Chunchunmaru! Megumin sugests",
    "I exterminate shiny aipoms right now, no mrecy",
    "Does the Executioner counts? I would ask him about his 'legendary' weapons and how 'awesome' he is",
    "Awans then she remembered she didn't put on 1 sock",
    "Honesty I preferred GREEN for 2 major reasons: it looked more unique amongst Tig skins AND skill effects were way more smooth.\nHaven't seen them on enemy side but if that were similar, than it would be easier to get hit by them since you haven't seen them",
    "I would rather something less greasy and flavor-less.\nIt's simply English way to compete with cattle in methane production.",

    "Yup saw it quite a few times already",
    "Well you have seen just a few then... Mediocre at best",
    "ME WANT!",
    "If you add raiser your board will be higher. That makes you do higher \"one leg squat\" EVERY single time u try to push. It MAKES the difference!\nI think he went for street cruiser build with short but agile board with short board and longboard truck and wheels for stability.\nThat means crazy slaloms while scrolling around town in a crowd, and effortless pushing."
