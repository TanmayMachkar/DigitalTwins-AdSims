    "du verstehst gar nicht, was OP bedeutet. er meinte ja, leute sogar auf b2/c1 niveau posten auf englisch, was er schade findet. er sagte nicht, dass jeder auf deutsch posten soll oder dass die mods beitr\u00e4ge auf englisch verbieten sollen, sondern dass er glaubt, wir k\u00f6nnen uns mehr m\u00fche geben.",
    "i editted my response a few times because i had to search up how to use \u4e86 . hope you saw the new updates!",
    "sflr i didn't receive notifications for some reason. \n\n??? im confused about the 4 examples you gave lol. \n\nyes I'm a native speaker. \u4e86 is nornally used like\n\n\u201c\u5403\u9971\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\u201d (are you already full?)\n\n \u201c\u5403\u9971\u4e86\u201d (im already full)\n\n\u201c\u529f\u8bfe\u4f60\u505a\u5b8c\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\u201d (have you finished your homework already)\n\n\u201c\u505a\u5b8c\u4e86\u201d (finished my homework already)\n\nbut to be honest, you need the \u4e86 if not it sounds incomplete. Like you cannot respond to \u5403\u9971\u4e86\u5417 with \u5403\u9971. \n\n(side note: \u5403\u9971\u5417 sounds okay to me but i feel like grammatically that's wrong? idk sorry im not a chinese teacher i just go based on gut feeling)\n\ni think i kinda understand the change in state. \n\nlike you can say \u201c\u6211\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e2a\u59d1\u5a18\uff01\u201d (i became a woman!)\n\nif you remove it it sounds like in the future you will become a woman\n\nwhen i search online it seems like there are 2 uses for \u4e86\n\n1. to mark that an action is completed (or, already done)\n\ni.e. \u5403\u5b8c\u4e86 (the plate is empty now)\n\n\u4ed6\u8d70\u4e86 (he already left, probably a long time ago)\n\n\u4ed6\u521a\u8d70\u4e86 (he already left, a short time ago)\n\n\u6211\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u534e\u8bed (i've mastered the chinese language)\n\n\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdf\u5230\u4e86 (you are already late)\n\n2. to mark that something has changed into something (used with verbs that mean \"change\") (but actually this meaning is like the one above, because it means that the transformation is complete)\n\ni.e. \u8fd9\u7897\u6c64\u51bb\u6210\u51b0\u4e86 (this soup froze already/became ice)\n\n\u4f60\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5b66\u6210 (you became into a great student)\n\n\u8fd9\u5f20\u7eb8\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u98de\u673a (this paper became an airplane)",
    "people do wear something like kebayas in real life. it's definitely a fashion thing. I know my peranakan grandmother would wear something like a kebaya but little more casual (i.e. pants instead of skirt), and i've seen people wear the kebaya skirt with just a tank top. There are looser, casual versions of the kebaya that people do wear in everyday lives. some malay muslim people when they go to the mosque will wear batik prints (which is the print that kinda looks like the prints on kebayas). \n\ndont get me wrong, the absolute average singaporean would just wear something from uniqlo, shorts and slippers, but you do have the occasional fashionista wearing more traditional clothing. (kebaya/batik and sarong and sari are more common to see casually than cheong sam but yeah)\n\ndisclaimer: im not a fashion historian or what, i just am an average sgean speaking from personal experience.\n\n\nedit: if you are visiting singapore and want to get your mum something like that, visit arab street, they have lots of shops doing kebaya/nonya kebaya. i mean you could also probably go to malaysia or indonesia, which is probably cheaper",
    "he said basically \n\n- i wish i could be healthy, have a driver license, work like you all do.\n\n- but i have to stay in the hospital all year\n\n- i have to fight everyday and i am still fighting but i am grateful that i am still alive, but the fight is hard\n\n- maybe you all dont have this worries, but i do unfortunately",
