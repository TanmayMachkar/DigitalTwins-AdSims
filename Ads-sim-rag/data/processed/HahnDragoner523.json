    "She deserves to have a cup of ramen poured over her head",
    "Cleric main casting stat is WIS but concentration checks use CON. So you want those at 16 in character creation and get WIS to 20 as you progress through the game. \n\nINT is your dump stat so 8 is fine. If she is not your avatar/party face CHA 8 is also fine. \n\nTrickery Domain is one of the weaker cleric subclasses so if you decide to change her subclass to one that gives her heavy armor proficiency you can drop DEX to 10 and take the Alert feat.\nDEX however also affects initiative so 14 DEX is always good even with heavy armor.\n\nA lot about how to play clerics comes down to spell usage. Although they can excel at any role if built correctly, they are often intended to be support. Great Spells to use early game are sanctuary, create water and bless to name a few.\n\nNote that cantrips gained from race use INT as their casting stat.\n\nEarly on your spell save DC is also fairly low. So it\u2019s better to avoid save\u2013or\u2013suck spells that require enemies to fail a saving throw until you can increase your spell save DC.",
    "Full feature length Blasto movie",
    "Ok so as someone who doesn\u2019t know how to cook: how tf do you get a picture on a cake?! Is there some kind of 3d food printer out there no one ever told me about? I am curious about the logistics.",
    "The UNSC, though they are fighting for humanity, has fashist and colonialist elements. Not to mention the horror shitshow that is ONI.",
    "I don\u2019t know enough about marvel but if the character is not a black woman in the source material I can definitely see a point to this discussion. Adaptations should be faithful to the source. If you want to fundamentally change a character\u2019s identity it\u2019s better to create an original character rather than bastardize an already existing and established one. It\u2019s downright disrespectful. For example, I wouldn\u2019t want them to turn Sgt. Johnson from Halo into a white chick.",
    "Both are gay",
    "I hate GO with every fiber of my being. The original was so much better.",
    "I agree with most of what people have said. However! A tool that lets someone realize a vision they normally would not be able to, due to debilitating conditions or lack of talent sounds like a magic item straight from a dream. No need to spend years on study and practice just to never get it right in the end. Here\u2019s an idea or concept  - boom, done.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite there yet but one day it may equalize the playing field between the gifted and the (less fortunate) mundane. \n\nI find this progression of technology beautiful. To circumvent natural barriers and to be able to create something you never could have on your own is an amazing concept and imo peak humanity. \n\nWe\u2019ve been doing shit like this ever since cavemen invented the spear. It\u2019s interesting to see we are not yet done.",
    "I hate this not available in your location type shit. Why can\u2019t this just be on mangadex like everything else? Is there another site where this chapter is available for everyone?",
    "I\u2019m sure it was true at some point but nowadays we have CP2077 and BG3",
    "The entirety of the **** TV show. That shit is so ass I refuse to acknowledge its existence.",
    "Thank",
    "Mods used?",
    "A new PvP game mode and map after who knows how long and it\u2019s the most balanced one we\u2019ve ever had. \n\nImprovements can certainly be made. It\u2019s not Titanfall 3 but as a PvP enjoyer I can\u2019t complain. (And I don\u2019t think we should)",
    "Do A.I.s count? If yes, Cortana. If no, T1000.",
    "Humans are so easily entertained",
    "Watch out. They\u2019re cute but they piss EVERYWHERE",
    "Larians impeccable attention to detail strikes again. Both his sword and scourger are Battlemaster themed, granting the wielder Commanders Strike. It only makes sense for Ravenguard himself to be a battlemaster fighter.",
    "It\u2019s always a tad ironic seeing a Selunite Shart walking around with Sharran apparel. That\u2019s the word, right? Ironic?",
    "People always think the Blue Jay is evil but in reality it\u2019s just bird logic.",
    "It might be helpful to know everything you\u2019ve already done in Act III. I heard if you kill Harvard Willoughby in the Elfsong you unlock a sheep pet in the Rivington camp.",
    "I demand someone post Faputa",
    "Moving up in the world, eh? Good for her.",
    "If we\u2019re sticking to the celestial day and night cycle I suggest Lathander.",
    "Both are gay",
    "100 Mist Nobles rented a car and ran over my dog going 60 miles per hour",
    "Shart and Minthara actually have the same body shape. They even have moles in the same places.",
    "It just struck me but you can recreate a ton of popular internet memes in this game using just heads and photo mode",
    "If that is true then not all chapters have been translated yet. Mangadex only goes up to ch43, other places have up to ch67 and that still isn\u2019t all of them.",
    "It\u2019s still around. Just doesn\u2019t get posted to this sub for some reason.",
    "This is awesome",
    "Give her slightly bigger breasts and she could pass for a vtuber.",
    "They were already special to begin with. Out of billions less than a hundred were chosen. The IIs were arguably destined to be \"superhuman\".",
    "How\u2019s you manage to keep your oath till act 3? Mine broke after fighting Balthazar in the Shadowfell.",
    "She shouldn\u2019t have been a LI in the first place. Why is it almost impossible for manga to have a romcom without a love triangle at some point in the story?",
    "Midas Touch",
    "Minthy being unabashedly evil is actually one of her good points!",
    "Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t have camp followers. Get a hireling to cast warding bond and just leave them at camp.",
    "That just comes with being a spellcaster. Solution: have someone cast Warding Bond on you.",
    "Act 1: tsun \u2013> Act 2: (tsun)dere \u2013> Act 3: dere",
    "Honestly, she improved it",
    "6.666 likes. I was here.",
    "He sings in the goblin camp because he is forced to (and he is quite bad at it). Him giving you Bard stuff as a reward can be explained by him giving away stuff he doesn\u2019t need because, again, he is not a Bard.",
    "Go for the hat\u2013trick I always say",
    "They really had Matt Mercer voice a man who doesn\u2019t fuck",
    "There needs to be a heretic slot so we can pick cultist-chan",
    "I blame Zentreya",
    "If I heard this response without knowing it was ChatGPT I would 100% think it was thought up by human. Scary stuff."
