Where there are new areas of the city being shown and the story is being played out through the eyes of newer characters.they don\u2019t have to survive though. I guess something similar to the operation raccoon city game. I wouldn\u2019t even mind seeing story of the chaos that took place before Leon entered the city.",

It is best to start clearing whatever content you have left in the account,get your daily login rewards,save enough crystals for a chance to get some ascended units. As for the equip summon.maybe go for something that will give artgen,preferably burst arts.",
