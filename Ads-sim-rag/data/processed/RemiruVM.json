    "There are a few reasons I think that way, there are almost no downsides to it as long as you live in any first world country (which is nowadays almost everywhere).  \nSocial Life & Dating: Everyone treats you better even if you look bad as long as you are a woman. You'll have endless choices as in dating aswell. I know someone who lost his son dozens of people asked him how his wife was doing, but no one gave a shit about his feelings.  \nThere are countless reasons, but this is the easiest to understand reason i guess.",
    "Call my mom and plan thinks through. How do i explain it to work and the state that i am a female now without making a big deal out of it. Think about sexual orientation, but once everything is settled, i d proably be sad and happy at the same time. Life will be 100 x easier, but i definitely don't wanna have menstruation or having to give birth.",
    "Ich hatte themen, die in die Richtung gingen in Wahlpflichtmodulen. Nicht auf hohem level, aber kam auf jeden Fall vor.",
    "Habe mein IT Studium beendet und arbeite jetzt als Entwickler seit 7 Monaten. Auszubildende haben durchgehend komische spr\u00fcche gebracht wie \"studieren ist einfach, man hat voll viel zeit\" usw. Es hat sich rausgestellt, dass ich als arbeitender derzeit 10 x mehr zeit habe und ich hobbylos geworden bin, sodass ich mir ein Fahrrad gekauft habe und  t\u00e4glich damit rumfahre vor langweile. Ich habe nie den hate von Auszubildenden explizit Studenten gegen\u00fcber verstanden",
    "So jemanden w\u00fcrde ich als Trainee vielleicht ne chance geben. sehr geringes gehalt und einlernen. Wenn er sich gut tut, einen anst\u00e4ndigen vertrag nach einem jahr. Mit so einem lebenslauf kriegt er sonst nirgends was.",

    "He seems to not give a single shit if they pass. He tells them what to do, if they do not listen, he will just repeat and not give a shit. Not judging him, he probably cannot be bothered anymore.",
    "I am not really in the matter, since i do Software developement and not game developement, but I cannot imagine this being the devs fault because it happens so frequently.  Maybe in Cods case, but this must be an engine problem or language problem. It probably becomees automatically a big sizes game because the engine is poory optimized  (Unreal Engine 5 etc.).",
    "Fu I didn't know about gojo. This post should be banned",
    "Ja jetzt wo ich 1 Jahr fest fristlos arbeite, merke ich das das menschliche bzw. die Arbeitsatmosph\u00e4re mehr als die halbe Miete ist. Wenn Ein Unternehmen im Prozess schon komisch wirkt und einen nicht respektiert, dann direkt ablehnen.",
    "Nach meinem Bachelor und 4 Jahre Programmiererfahrung als Werkstudent, habe ich 7 Monate keine Stelle gefunden bis ich eingestellt worden bin. Jetzt 1 Jahr sp\u00e4ter haben viele Unternehmen, die mich im Prozess eliminiert haben mich sogar manchmal angerufen und mich gebeten um ein Gespr\u00e4ch. Ich habe allen abgesagt. Mein jetziges Unternehmen hat erkannt, dass ich mehrwert mitbringe und entlohnt mich entsprechend. Jetzt werde ich weitergeschult richtung KI und ich habe nicht vor zu wechseln. Auch nicht in 2,4 oder 6 Jahren. Leider sind die meisten Unternehmen zu dumm um langfristig in Personal zu investieren und versagen dadurch.",

    "Ich benutze es regelm\u00e4\u00dfg als suchmaschine. Vor paar Jahren habe ich auf der arbeit (softwareentwickler) noch regelm\u00e4\u00dfig google genutzt, um zu recherschieren. Jetzt nutze ich nur noch chatGPT um mich schneller in Themen einzuarbeiten und Infos zu finden. Du wei\u00dft gar nicht wie viel Zeit ich mir dadurch schon gespart habe. Das gute ist, dass du nicht mehr in Foren von komischen Leuten fragliche wege bekommst und die l\u00f6sung zu deinem Problem oder die richtige (beste) info raussuchen musst. Jetzt einen kurzen satz und chatgpt sucht hunderte von seiten mit quellenangaben f\u00fcr dich direkt raus. du kannst sogar angeben welche quellen er nutzen und welche er nicht nutzen soll. Diese speichert er als errinerung. Du hast offensichtlicherweise ChatGPT noch nicht produktiv genutzt, sodass du starke probleme hast es einzuordnen oder du bist einfach nur negativ eingestimmt, weil ChatGPT in anderer art irgendwie dein leben schlecht beinflusst. Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass jemand es nutzt und nicht realisiert wie viel besser als google es ist.",

    "Theese kind of lists are more like which anime speaks to most people. Frieren is a slice of life adventure anime, that is good in every aspect and has also some action in it. While i agree that AOT is generally better, not everyone likes this brutality and action only kind of anime.\n\nThink of different people in your life. Your familymembers, your friends and so on. Most people will like Frieren, but i am sure that most Mothers would not like AOT or HxH.",

    "I swear i do this at all times. Ever since i started doing this 10years ish ago, I never got into trouble where i was the root problem. It always ended up being other people messing up. That rule is good and i advice everyone to stay by it. If you need to say something that you cannot justify, at least sugarcoat it in a way where its still leaning towards being justfifyable. Most things can be phrased better where you are save",
    "Germany handles it quite well. We get paid \"Baf\u00f6q\" which is basically payment for going to school if your income is too low. It makes it possible to get by with a minijob if you fulltime study, without having to be work more then that. Unfortunately the state works very slow so that it can take over 3 months to process a simple application for it.",
    "shelves with books maybe?",
    "In der IT sagen die Unternehmen immer \"Fachkr\u00e4ftemangel\", was daran liegt, dass keiner anst\u00e4ndiges Gehalt mit guten Konditionen geben will. Bis ich meinen jetzigen Job gelandet habe, hats 7 Monate gedauert. Jetzt bin ich aus der Probezeit raus und durch den guten Vertrag habe ich auch vor hier zu bleiben. Sind 9 / 10 Unternehmen selbst schuld, wenn Sie zu kurzfristig denken und nicht in gutes Personal investieren wollen. Das witzige ist, viele Unternehmen die mir unter 50k Jahresbrutto geboten hatten mit schlechten Konditionen, haben mich im nachhinein mit einem anst\u00e4ndigeren Vertrag nochmal angeschrieben. Aber jetzt ist es zu sp\u00e4t.",

    "Nach K\u00f6ln zu ziehen um zu studieren ist deine Entscheidung. Das Unterhalt ist DEIN Geld. Das muss deine Mutter verstehen. Wenn deine Mutter diese Sachen nicht respektiert, w\u00fcrde ich dar\u00fcber nachdenken, ob Sie wirklich das beste f\u00fcr dich will. Sorg f\u00fcr ein Studienplatz und sag deinem Vater er soll dir das Geld \u00fcberweisen. Dannach zieh nach K\u00f6ln und studiere.",
    "I live in germany and had packages on the stairs for over a day for years now and never have people stolen it. Not in my current appartment, not in my previous one. I wonder if germany is just save or i have been lucky?",

    "Literally every aspect of life. Dating. I had professors give better grades to woman then man, because the woman asked nicely, but never the other way around. When a woman is feeling down, everyone is taking care, but no one gives a shit about a mans feelings. A woman has value by simply existing after the age of 18. A man only has value after he is set in life, which is usually around the age of 30. I have seen countless examples. Friends of mine who just recently started to be set in life, are all of a sudden now beeing treated nicer by family and friends, or strangers who hear of their occupation.",
    "Because woman get treatet like goddesses and boys as trash. This gets a bit better after age 30, but is still extremly frustrating as a man.",
    "I was TGS in S1 and i barely used armor moves with reina. Now in season 2 (if i play that is) i ve seen myself using armor move exessively because in most situations, it is the only way out. Sad state the game is in.",
    "Lets just say a healthy combination of all, including the boycott",
    "He is disgusting that's the point. By the end of the current season he has developed as a person a lot. If you want perfect anime chars from the get go, watch one of those copy paste isekais",
    "Considering how gamebreaking characters like King and lars still are in this patch, and how easily they chould've fixed that shit, it is way to slow. If they sincerely take several months to fix easy broken stuff like that, i am out.",
    "Another like 10 of theese patches in this size and we may have a playable game yet again. It goes in the right direction, but if they  continue with this pace, the game will take until next year to become somewhat balanced. This addressed like 10 % of the ongoing problems.  \nPersonally i hope the mai patch is bigger then this. Happy, but a little disapointed",
    "You working at bamco or are you murray? By now it should be clear even to the last fanboy of those 2, that Its cleary nakatsu and murray making theese shots. Nakatsu is the Director and Murray is second in command which they hinted several time now over the last years. Every bullshit that made it through, eventually were made by them. The shot came from them and they were okay with it.",
    "There are just tooooo many hurdles for tekken 8 to become a stable game again. First and foremost the devteam. Its clear as shit that they have no clue about what they are doing. Second they don't test shit. So many crucial bugs and oversights, an unbelieveably unstable, broken balance state made it through. No one can tell me it got tested. The core problem is that the people in charge need to change. Nakatsu and murray need to immediately get fired and replaced by people that know their shit.",
    "I don't understand what you don't understand honestly. Pokes in T8 are already weak in comparison to older games. now they will become weaker once again. There is a reason all the pros and content creators didn't like that change. Lets just wait and see",
    "damn  some people really don't understand. It will not be worth playing a poking  playstyle, when it barely does dmg and takes forever to kill. Its smarter to just fish for a launch and do like 100 dmg at once. It leans towards a more boring kind of playstyle which most people dislike. If a df1 does like 13 dmg, I would have to df1 successfully almost 20 times, while i could technically just do 1.5 launchers for the same shit.",
    "increasing the health will only lead to pokes being obsolete. it will make the game even more so that you have to offense your way into a launcher and win that way. boring asf",
    "I switched to lobby matches  with friends only. Used to mainly play ranked. If the emergency patch does not go into the right direction, i am out. Uninstall and maybe 1-2 months after tekken 9 launch (if that will happen after this shit).",
    "I would actually pay a good amount of money to get a version of this game, but official.",
    "I wish that was our major problem right now",
    "I mean in math \u2796 and \u2796 is plus",
    "I always knew back from his tutorials in early t7 days, that he was one of the dumbest known tekken figures. Its just best to ignore him, believe me.",
    "they sould remove heat and adjust the homing / realigning moves and we gucci",
    "yea but street fighter 6 is designed with that in mind though. It was always meant to be that way and they did a good job with that. Tekken does not work with 50 / 50 offense no skill mixups.",
    "If by \"survive\" you mean the servers will stay online, then yes, for sure. If you mean, having an active playerbase remotely comparable to now? hell no",
    "This game will not survive to season 3. Even if they fix it then, by that time, most people will have moved to another game.",
    "how is looking at steamcharts projecting? I am just saying it is lower then when a title update drops usually? Are you working at bamco and pissed then i am right?",
    "Are you intentionally ignoring what i wrote? I said  a major title update JUST RELEASED. Its NORMAL that it goes up for a few days. Also the peak should be waaaaay higher right now and the increase is already declining very fast with the low being under 4k now which is the lowest tekken 8 has ever been.",
    "Point being post patch the avg should ve gone up to at least 10k for a month. It didn't, it is still around 6-7k declining FAST. The point is Even though its a major title update, the numbers are rather falling, then increasing which is unprecendentet. Its normal even if the patch is bad, that people are trying it out for a few days so the peak and avg went up for only like a week.",
    "you need to consider its right post patch. Pre patch it was around 6k and post patch it was expected to be around 10k and never under like 7 if the patch were playable at least.",
    "Spag has always been bamcos dog. They command, he does. Doesn't matter what he thinks. dogs just do",
    "thats what tekken 8 has been reduced to. 200+ moves and you just have to use 1. thats how you are supposed to play this now",
    "i wish everyone would just jump back to t7 so we can overtake 8 until they fix (if possible)",
    "Kinda poor guy, he is on a good roll as a tekken streamer, so he can't just quit and has to play. But if he plays, his morale decreases, which makes him unhappy. the devteam should be fired and sued honestly. this is abuse and intentional harm man",
    "yea but now they get punished for throwing out the 4 part. Its actually refreshing. Unfortunate that they buffed him soo much overall",
    "Ah ofc, probably true. Didn't know that it makes a difference",
    "I played on alt chars last season all the time on blue rank and they ONLY use that move and d2. I am in europe, maybe it varies from region to region?",
    "I tell you what genius, if my salary magically goes up with inflation, making it be about 20-30 % more in 8 years, then I won't complain, until then, keep your smartass meme to yourself",
    "Lets be real. The vast majority doesn't like Lidia and Eddy, making them a big mistake. They should've not even been in the base roaster, but straight up ended up not returning. Heihachi should ve been base roaster and clive has an interesting design, but it should ve been Tifa.\n\nBalance - They had over a year and didnt change shit, making us play shitty season 1 and then drop this utter shithole on us, making season 1 look like the best patch ever.\n\nThey need to Fire Nakatsu and Murray, put someone competent as Director and then completly fire the entire balance team. Then they should revert and go start fixing stuff from season 1 again.",
    "I could ve not phrased it better. You quite literally took the words out of my mind. Thanks for writing this",
    "The \"I got a life\" card can be phrased better and in some discussions is a good argument, but in 9 / 10 cases, its unfortunately used in the wrong manner, escelating the situation.",
    "no, your point actually does not make any sense. Leaving negative reviews, makes people NOT buy the game, which in turn is a loss for tekken in terms for numbers and money which does hurt them A LOT. So again...no, I don't get your point.",
    "I already opted to sf6 when mai dropped and reached 17k, hopped back to tekken to check out whether season 2 fixes anything. Since it made everything 10 x worse, i am never comin back",
    "murray doesn't even realize how hard he fkd up. They quite literally killed the game and he is still all gooda and dandy",
    "no one is saying because its so obvious. go into the patch, look it up and if you re not completly new you ll understand",
    "it does. i ve seen countless people not buying the game because its mixed or mostly negative",
    "If you read all the patch notes and tested the chars out, followed social media for all the bs thats possible and played a little online AND STILL think this afterwards, then you re a lost cause",
    "I am nervous and hyped at the same time",
    "the only way i see t9 story being good, is when they let some good writer COMPLETLY RESET the story. Like he is allowed to actually redo everything and ignore everything up till now, because the tekken univere sucks ass",
    "thank you",
    "Its easy to fall into the delusion of thinking she is a strong character, when it truth she is quite weak. FF+2 was stupid, before it got nerved, but now that it is easy to ss in most cases, thats no longer the case. She does not have anything that excels, her heat smash sucks ass, she has a bad hellsweep in comparison to the other mishimas and no other low besides that. To top all of that off she is one of the most linear characters in existence with very bad homing moves.\n\nShe is quite literally one of the easiest to counter characters, if you lab her and know what to do. Its not even hard to lab her. The Problem is that some people don't lab her, go get fkd by good players and then go on to stream about how stupid and broken she is. I've seen GoD players try getting her to GoD and fail, other succeed but say afterwards, that she is very weak in comparison to others.",
    "I agree that Bryan is way easier and carried then in t7",
    "I said this before. If TMM is related to changes in T8, this game is done for. Generally picking just 1 is not good. Even if you're a pro player, its often required to have at least  5 different people of high skill lvl to somewhat balance a game correctly.",
    "I feel like they will either not patch some stuff in, or hotfix it out within a few weeks. I won't believe they sincerely patch some of that shit in",
    "if tmm becomes somewhat involved in changes regarding this game, I am 10000 % sure this game will die within a year max.",
    "I feel exactly the same",
    "Yes Sir",
    "VIIIIIICTOOOOOOOOOOORRYYYY!!!",
    "When my ass finished processing the food",
    "Disappointed",
    "So 1/4 of the people dont want to know what they re paying for. Could be the biggest horseshit, but hey...take my money",
    "starting s2, i don't fucking care about defense anymore. wont lab anymore. just brainlessly mash and beat all those veterans real quick. ez",
    "yea my bad, wtf was i thinking",
    "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...\n\nAK is cool, but for the love of god, please kuni first",
    "Color wise + returning char, it has to be Lei / Marduk + Kuni right?"
