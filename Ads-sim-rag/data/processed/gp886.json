    "Funny thing, the ancient Chinese had this system as well. The government organized massive date events which you had to go once in three years at least. Each year you didn't get married, the single tax increased. The population was way more precious in the ancient era. People believe that marriage was created in ancient India to deal with population issues and child rearing.\n\nDespite that, don't think this is gonna work as well they think it will. It will just cause resentment among people. Population increase or decrease is more related to culture than anything else.",

    "I have 2 dream games. \n\nOne is a Ubisoft type open world game like Far Cry based on Captain America The First Avenger movie. The tutorial can be Steve Roger's training camp, where he is chosen. First mission will be killing the hydra agent who killed Dr. Selvig. And then you go to the European theatre, destroying one Hydra Base after the other. Exploring Europe, stealing Volkswagen, foiling one Hydra Project after another, getting upgrades from Stark, forming a 4 man team (multiplayer possibility) for missions etc. There is gunplay, shield play, a COD Ops type of game in a superhero setting.\n\nAnother is a personal fantasy of an open world RPG game based in mythological India, immediately after the Pandavas left the mortal realm. There are still godly powers there in the society and a lot of characters from Mahabharata are still active as kings and queens and royals. It can be a story that maybe explores the politics after the Mahabharata ended, or about proper disposal of mythological weapons like the Brahmastra and other weapons in the Mahabharata for preventing anyone to use it and knowledge to use it. Maybe prevent foreign attacks on kingdoms weakened by the great war in the north. You decide. And a small personal story of the character. Something like New Vegas and Skyrim set in Ancient India mythological kingdoms. You can see the magnificent Pandava palace, Dwarkadesh when it was all one, Gandhara, Magadha, Taxila and all ancient lands and universities and temples in their glory.",

    "Honestly no. Not that it's not a great anime, but it's still not complete. There has been undoubtedly better anime than FMAB. But what makes FMA: B the best is the completeness of the story. If you just stand back and look at the show in its entirety, my god it's a beautiful picture. And currently Frieren whatever we can see is great and better than FMAB. But so was Attack on Titan at one point. But it's when an anime gets completed that you understand its place in the world. Same with One Piece. Peak fiction, but not complete. Its ending will determine whether it was worth it. Game of Thrones is the prime example for this. It was peak television, but the ending sucked ass, and now I just don't want to do anything with the world of song of ice and fire.\n\nLet Frieren complete, then we'll talk.\n\nHonestly if we just wanna talk in single seasons and arcs, my favourite will always be S1 of One Punch Man.

    "Honestly, yes. Heath Ledger's depiction of the Joker showed the depth of cinema. No written character could have had as much impact as he had with just his ticks and behaviour. It was not only the dialogues, but the way he moved, the way he talked. Honestly for me he elevated the film to a never seen before level. It is definitely one of the greatest pieces of fiction ever just for the sheer insanity of Heath Ledger's Joker.\n\nI just feel so horrible that he was taken from us so soon. If he was still there, Heath Ledger just might have become one of the best actors in the world and we might have had a successor of Daniel Day Lewis.",

    "Just watch the earlier One piece episodes again. What she did for those villagers, for Usopp and for Luffy during his first meeting. So many times has she questioned her place on the crew, whether she truly belongs. Something she talked to Usopp about before he gave her the Clima-Tact. She acts self narcissistic but deep inside she is not confident in herself. It was later she gained confidence, not due to her own abilities, but trusting her teammates. Only overcoming true fear and cowardice can make you a brave person. \n\nPlus the best thing about her is not even that. It's her dream. A dream of navigating and mapping the entire world. Just like Amelia Earhart. Just like Nelie Bly who went around the world in 72 days. These were real life woman heroines. They were not stronger than men. But their dreams gave them so much strength along with their team.\n\nMaybe you dont like Nami, but then what about the other ladies mentioned as well.",
    "Depends. What do you think of it? But it's fiction. A story. Definitely would have different view points.",
    "Unironically, One Piece. \n\nHonestly watching again, Nami is truly the soul of the Strawhat crew. She's not the strongest and one of the only strawhat crew without any haki or devil fruit powers. But her strength lies in sheer willpower and guts. With no power she was willing to stab a knife through her hand to protect Usopp, close her hands around a super hot thread burning on a dry thread on a cannon to protect Luffy, a guy she had just met. She will hit the guys doesn't matter if they are the yonkai, greatest swordsman or whatever. They are her family and I am pretty sure, she still would jump to take a bullet shot at Luffy, zoro or sanji without caring whether they can take it or not. She's the mama bear of the crew\n\nAnd Robin. My god, the mental strength required to smile through the pain, choosing to go back to the Marines knowing she'll die and everything her family and village members died for will be useless and forgotten just to protect her teammates. And then broke through and asked for help when her teammates came to save her. Always hiding her pain, acting composed but being clumsy and emotionally exposed and saving her smile for her closest friends.\n\nAnd so, so, so many characters. Princess Vivi, not unwilling to bow her head to protect her family. Boa Hancock, Big Mama's amazing daughters. All of them. Koala, my god, I am already crying. Oda Sensei really knows how to write real female characters. Honestly I don't know why One Piece doesn't have a larger female audience. I know such amazing female characters in real life. So I even as a man can completely relate to them. Of course there is fan service, but I'll allow it a little.",

    "A second heart would be good. I mean we have 2 kidneys, the heart isn't too big as well. Flights have 2 engines, 2 hearts would be great as well.\n\nLarger brain to accommodate better memory and analysis through better folds.\n\nBetter skin protection to deal with UV rays as Ozone layer is fast depleting, so needs better protection from skin cancer. So more melanin and hair follicles.\n\nMore powerful lungs as with increasing sea levels, we need to be able to live under the sea, and with two hearts, more oxygenated blood can be handled.\n\nAnd a much thicker neck, as the head weight increases with larger brain, the blood supply need to increase. Double hearts will help with that, but neck is a bottleneck. A thicker neck will help with that as well.\n\nSo two hearts, thicker neck, larger and more folded brain and a thicker neck. Oh and better skin to help with cooling effect and protect from UV rays.",

    "It's too big. It was not a compliment though, she was asking me to slow down. I felt sad that my penis caused her pain, but also felt proud for having a large dick. And this was when I lost my virginity. So I always wondered if my penis was big enough for women to enjoy, and if size does matter, as I watched a lot of corn. Realized two things, one, yes it's big enough, and no, anything above 6 is a weapon of mass destruction and painful for woman. You need to use it carefully.",
    "With the tax on Guthka. I don't think so.",
    "Oh we do have laws preventing that. But we just don't have the manpower to handle it. 100000 people per policeman. And ultimately it is dependent on society to resolve these issues. History is the proof. Laws rejected by society is abused without consequences or broken down.

    "1. Remove Limiter\n2. King's Luck\n3. Blank's Intelligence \n4. Overhaul\n\nAs for the anime I want to go into is something with a bad ending, and a dark world so I can repair it with these powers. I want to say Berserk so badly. But I'll choose HunterxHunter.\n\nHumans are occupying a small part of the world. Great characters to make friends with, and lots of places to use my powers. And I love exploration. There's so much to do in that world. It's a bit light hearted as well.",
    "Fairytale lands are just impossible, it's possible just as a perspective as it means that the desires of people are killed off. Or the protagonist is the one who's gonna tear down that facade. \n\nHeroic Worlds are the goal. It's what everyone strives for. These are I believe the light hearted slice of life anime deals. Usually at the end of an epic battle.\n\nNoblebright worlds are just reformed gilded worlds, where the story is preceded by mighty heroes fighting a huge war to maintain some semblance of balance but not fully eradicate the evil. Something like the start of LOTR, after the huge battle when Isildur does not throw the ring, but they still have peace. Can be start of a great story. But the story needs to dip into a Gilded world atleast.\n\nGilded world is the best setting for a story where you want a happy ending, bring the world to Heroic or even Noblebright. My favourite setting. Because even though it's bad, hope is still alive. And the hero needs to go through impossible odds and so much challenge to achieve their goals. There is no guarantee of success. No Deus ex machina. Just luck and hope and courage. You are actually invested, as it's a gamble. Either Heroic or Grimdark.\n\nGrimdark world. Abandon all hope who enter. Some lighthearted stories, lots of action. The best part about these stories is to show, that even when nothing is going to improve, there is no hope, people still will find a way to be good. Find hope. Even though these pockets of light are sniffled, they still find a way to be reignited. The best Grimdark worlds are where hope hasn't died yet. Because light makes the shadows darker. Without hope darkness becomes the new light, the new norm, and that's useless.",

    "Power to manipulate people's minds. \n\nIt's a billion dollar industry and history has been shaped by people who have come close to that superpower. Imagine, pushing an idea across millions of people, an idea that most people seriously consider. That will just become the identity of every human. It can be anything. Stop smoking, protect the environment, stop using plastics, never kill another, love each other. Or kill each other, hate a particular community, all pain is caused by certain entities, you'll have eternal happiness in the afterlife if only you can bear the pain of certain activities in this life.\n\nSounds familiar. Yup, cults, the biggest religions around, super famous and powerful politicians present and past. All of them have the power to distort people's minds, through different techniques. Marketing guys selling products and getting you hooked, like Coco melon, the Marlboro man, pepsodent etc. Lots of money in this. And honestly, people might fight against it, but it's always depends on what you do with this power. If the unaffected people's lives are not changed or made different, or human ethics are not compromised, nobody would care. Or if you're fast enough that there are not enough people left to make a difference.\n\nAnd to have this power in its absolute essence, it's to lead human history. That's the full potential. Of course it can be wasted as well. All other powers are limited to the individual. This power makes use of the collective. Used for evil it'll cause so much destruction and will lead to a dystopia. Used correctly it'll give us a chance for a utopia.",

Exactly same with girls.\n\nIt's a human issue.",
    "You know it's really funny how people just collectively forget that the spine shown by Indian media was only towards the opposition parties. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was humiliated on media regarding Kargil coffins which was confirmed to be non issue. Modi himself was termed Maut ka Saudagar, different media articles running inflammatory articles on him, taking each word spoken in the worst context possible, even though he was given a clean chit by the Supreme Court and the CBI SIT team, which grilled him for more than 8 hours. Meanwhile, literally no interviews for Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh or the future leader Rahul Gandhi, until Modi comes to power or if there, literally softball questions. Even the disastrous interview by Rahul Gandhi to Arnab, the questions were very softball questions. No agenda to them. Yet no one talks about that.\n\nI completely understand (though don't agree) why Modi is reluctant to give interviews. Throughout 90s and 2000s he has had a terrible experience with them with interviewers setting up traps and dangerous questions that answered anyway will result in someone getting riled up. Anything he said was used against him on the front page of the newspaper. That's why Modi developed the Social Media counter so he does not rely on biased media to spread his words and speeches. There used to be a time that whenever the PM went to foreign countries under Congress there used to be a media contingent that followed. All companies that ran media were from the Lutyens lobbies, that was primarily Congress based except 2 or 3 media houses that BJP had control over.\n\nNow BJP, staying in power for 3 elections has power over the media. The day it goes out of power, this will be swinging to the Congress side again.",
    "I believe that it has been done so many times in the past. And so many perpetrators remained unpunished and celebrated as heroes. Only one instance of the whole world found how far it can go and stopped and introspected. Hitler's Germany. But at the same time massacres were taking place in the east, which people don't even remember by the Japanese, that even horrified the Germans and members of the SS. Do you know how brutal you have to be to horrify people who knew and worked in concentration camps. One battle is literally called the Rape of Nanjiang. Not massacre, pillage, but rape of an entire city. Only 7 were put to death and 16 life imprisonment while Emperor Hirohito lived in comfort.\n\nChengis Khan,\n\nTimur Lames pillage of Delhi,\n\nJapanese attacks on Korea and China,\n\nBrutality of European Colonialism all over the world,\n\nAmerican massacres of so many indigenous Indian tribes,\n\nOne chinese general I remember made defeated soldiers a deep pit and then buried all of them alive.\n\nAll examples of people unleashing unspeakable evils under orders.\n\nEasy? It's very easy. You know why, cause deep down we are animals. Animals with very smart brains. And that intelligence can make us civilized and reign in our base instincts but it can also fire it up, making those instincts, to hunt, to breed, far worse than even the most brutal feral animal in the world. Wars and fascism provide plenty of opportunities for this.\n\nI think there was a comparison between bears and men, who are safer for women. Bears, even the polar bear were hunted by humans for their pelts in their homes, taking their young to perform circus tricks. Bears just kill and don't even eat humans, just get rid of a threat. Bear meat is a very famous delicacy. \n\nAnd I am pretty sure, that terminid meat roasted by eagle bombs must be real popular amongst Helldivers as well. Especially the tough charger meat.",
    "2 favourite games. One for simply, gameplay \n\nGTA San Andreas.\n\nIt's the best GTA game ever, just based on the things you can do, and how this skinny black guy from the east coast becomes one of the big shots in San Andreas. Every single thing, planes, boats, underwater, bike schools, car schools, government conspiracies, gym, romance, iconic dialogues, plot twists. I think in no game can you do so much that affects and develops the character this much other than RDR2, and it is still missing a lot of things.

    "Honestly the right one is not wrong. Lim x->0 means it's close to 0. Divided by another thing close to 0. Sin 0 is is 0, so sin x will be close to zero as well. That means sin 0/0 = 0/0. But as the 0/0 is not actual 0, but close to zero, we can not consider 0/0 undefined rule. Hence 1.",
    "First of all regarding the rape stats, the problem it's trying to address is that India is more unsafe and problematic than other countries, trying to bring down the reputation of our country. It's comparative. India is not more unsafe regarding this. Some areas yes, but most areas not. That's stats. For people mentioning marital rape status and other things, it is a punishable offence as well. And the same hidden stats is same for other countries as well.\n\nSecond, no, even men be it attractive or unattractive ladies don't want unwanted attention. Being uncomfortable being stared at is human nature. If you're uncomfortable being stared at so do guys. The struggles of females in this country is worse, but that does not mean that you can deny the problems male faces completely as well.\n\nThe rest I completely agree. The less stats, and men facing similar issues does not take away the fact that ladies do in fact face a terrible time in society. Being stared at, and some scum doing even worse things. Not having even basic decency. There is no quick fix. Just making people aware. Speaking out against such behaviour. And shaming such people in public is the only way the deal with this issue. And we all should try to do that.\n\nMaybe I am a guy who tries to see good in the world, because otherwise, what's the point of living, but I genuinely feel there is good in society. Seen people who protect woman. Fathers and brothers and sons brought up right. Having courtesy and decency. And I seriously hope that you might be able to meet such people. It's men who have hurt you your entire life, but there must be some who are good as well. They are Indians as well. There is good. We need to believe that and make it come true.",

    "Stop comparing India and China. We are so different. China was born through a bloody revolution and war. We were born through a non violent revolution. Chinese worked on getting rid or suppression of any and all minorities, we were born through cooperation between so, so many different diverse communities of people, of different religion and languages. Chinese through a century of misery was able to purge all its old institutions, while India had to dismantle them slowly, a process still going on today as well. Modern China had one great leader, Deng Xiaoping rule continuously for 20 years, following Mao Zedong, who was a mixed bag, doing a lot of good but at great cost. India has had more than 10 prime ministers, each with their own agenda and direction of development. The British rule permeated through entire of India, religious divide between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Chinese had just the coastal areas attacked by foreign powers in coastal areas.\n\nIndia has done remarkably well I believe as a major democracy. Name one another major democracy with a large indigenous population who might have done even remotely as well as India. China, as much of a success story it has, I believe will face challenges regarding power transition. Any oligarchy has that problem. I believe centralized power is amazing and can transform any nation into a superpower **GIVEN** the leader is competent. And Deng Xiaoping was a dream leader by any standards, aided by a failing Soviet Union on its border and zero invasions and revolutions from within and without. India has had its share of inept leaders, Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi in her latter half, Moraji Desai who squandered all the good work done by other leaders. Also constantly fighting insurgency in north and east almost during its entire existence.\n\nScrew mentality. India has always struggled with lack of resources. Don't forget, India has been a protectionist state (even after liberalization, though it did reduce the scope) along with also given half of the budget at its Independence. Lack of Energy security (oil resources), reservation and so many other things have always led India to face an uphill battle. But it does so with the will of its people. All decisions have been made through representative powers and compromises. That's why even though we have so, so many problems so many people have profound love for this nation of ours. Because even the most horrible decisions have been made by prime ministers voted in by us. It's the responsibility of the voters.\n\nNow to mentality. Despite the serious lack of resources India has consistently punched above it's weight. Despite the largest population in the entire world, as a percentage we are doing average, which is a huge achievement. We have 1 policeman for 100000 people. Way worse than the next best. Despite that most of the areas except Eastern India is pretty safe.\n\nThat's my rant regarding the topic.",

    "How is stopping funding for WHO related to isolationism? US has treaties and deals with so many countries especially regarding health, vaccines and related research. US will not be isolated without WHO. US got the hydroxyquinine from India without help from WHO.\n\nAlso, oligarchs didn't vote Trump in. The US public did. He is the US president. They don't do it. It's their choice. But there is a choice, as they have better funds. Right now, there is literally no choice, as there is no money. You are saying even if they have money they won't spend it on debt and infrastructure. Alright it might be true. But also, hear me out. You might be wrong. Whatever it is.

    "The benefits provided by WHO to US is not worth the huge funding that is done by US. I agree that stopping the funding entirely was not the correct decision, but reducing funding is definitely correct. How much does Japan, India even China contribute to WHO. It's way less than US. So the whole world gets to reap benefits from US, while US pays for it. And then everyone is criticising the president, trying to stop the flow of funds when US itself is heavily under debt.\n\nIt's like scolding a formerly rich country under heavy debt for stopping charity to get their finances in order, saying you're still rich as you have a big house, even though that house is creaky and breaking in several places, and that, the charity will help on long term.

    "Strong economy means that private organisations are eating good. But it doesn't mean a thing to the government social and infrastructure programs. Why is the economy good? It's because of the shunting of profits and revenues to that small group of people. But unless government resolves the debt situation and starts spending millions of taxpayer dollars for infrastructure development, within 2 decades civilian development won't be good, and same for the economy. Current US economy is built on strong domestic spending and infrastructure development by past presidents. But wars and global platform based funding have depleted funds. There is a trillion dollar debt. It will require a decrease in government spending. Austerity measures have been done by so, so many countries. China, Germany, UK, Japan, Argentina being the latest example, have ran austerity measures to bring debt under control, and allow a stronger government spending capability. Any new infrastructure being built in US needs a new source of revenue, and only then it can be built.",

    "I believe it's Ashoka the great. It's because of him, that the idea of a combined India was formed. During freedom struggle, it was Ashoka the Great's stupa that gave the idea of a combined India. He spread Buddhism around the world, spreading India's name. Also I read somewhere that he might be responsible for setting his rule in Delhi for the first time ever. If it was not for Ashoka, maybe Prakrit would not have become the base line language for majority of North and our cultures would be far more different than they are now, not allowing for an integrated country.

    "BTW, I actually didn't read the manwha. I read the webnovels. And have completed them. Not going to lie, at first ORV was amazing. I think the past covered by the manwha till now was the amazing part. But for me the most important thing is how the story ends. How everything ties up together. ORV has a shitty ending. Solo Leveling has a good ending. That's it. So if you're going to read the manwha, just think about this. \n\nThe other manwha/webnovel I was talking about is **The Novel's Extra**. So the story follows a novelist whose novel is not popular and he is on hiatus. But his story is made in the real world, and he is thrown in that world as an extra character. He starts interacting with characters he has written himself about, and starts getting attached to those characters. The combat is so goddamn amazing, as the protagonist is a gun wielding badass in an age of magical swords and bows. He just wields guns, shotguns and sniper rifle to take out people like deadshot. It's so much fun. The best parts are combat and character interaction. Honestly I was expecting ORV to be similar, but as time goes by it just falls so much short of The Novel's Extra, especially in the last arc. It doesn't do a good job of tying everything up.",
    "Honestly, Solo Leveling is way better than ORV just because of its simple ending. ORV becomes too meta at the end. Dream within a dream bullshit. It was a drag to get through the end chapters. So much exposition. On the other hand Solo Leveling had a way more simple to understand premise, and was just good solid action and relation between characters. \n\nBTW, screw both of them. The best in this genre is none of them, it's definitely **A Novel's Extra**. The character relationship is just so good, and the last arc though the weakest, delivers an amazing ending. And man the gun based action is just so goddamn sweet. I believe it's the best novel in same genre as Solo Leveling and ORV. I have ready it 3 times and it's still so fun. Just imagine deadshot in an Isekai and a world with superheroes adb every one having powers, while OP just shoots good. So good.",

    "Great arguments all around. But there are some reasons why I believe in supporting Imperials:\n\n- If Skyrim can break away from the empire, the reach can break away from Skyrim. Unlike what people think, Skyrim is not united under the Nords. There are the Reach guys who had a whole complicated plot for freedom. And it wouldn't stop under Drafonborn or Upfric alone. And this whole mess was Ulfric's fault in the first place. The Reach's situation shows why a free Skyrim under Upfric Stormcloak, might be an issue. Who knows, there might be another revolution under him, as if he can overthrow the high king, so can he be overthrown.\n\n- Skyrim's economic situation. Yes, many people have mentioned how attacking Skyrim is hard, but it can be easily be economically throttled. Who are they gonna trade with? The Solstheim issue between Nords and dark elves, the racism and recent war with Imperials make the whole Skyrim province isolated. A frigid north which is isolated makes prices and inflation go up. There are literally only two areas with farming capacity, whiterun and riften. Trading is done under the Empire's trade fleet, so they need to build their own fleet to trade and defend from naval attacks.\n\n- The White Gold Concordat is not just a tool to build gap between Skyrim and Empire. They are genuine terms that High Elves believe in. They don't consider Talos, a human to be a god, as they believe elves are superior. So they will enforce and battle Skyrim. Many people are mentioning how Hammerfall defended itself, but they forget, that the Aldmeri Dominion had no clue they could be so successful. They wanted to conquer Khaljit provinces, and fight Hammerfall. But they reached Cyrodill too soon. They literally had no idea regarding the logistics. And then they were dealt a heavy blow in Cyrodill by the imperial army. And the war ended with the White Gold Concordat signed. So Aldmeri Dominion ended war on a loss, got a treaty which contains and achieves their main goals. It's like a fighter got sucker punched but the opponent surrendered. Why wouldnyou want to continue the fight. Aldmeri Dominion is not interested in Hammerfall by itself that's why when the the resistance began, High elves destroyed Hammerfall, but retreated. They had already won. Their enemy was The Empire, not Hammerfall. That's why no reinforcements.\n\n- And finally for all of Titus Mede's fallacy, one thing is for sure. He'll be gone by the end of the game. Either deposed or assassinated. So there will be a new ruler. So things might change. And the empire is against the white gold Concordat as well. And against the admeri dominion. Never did they execute ban on Talos worshippers. It was Thalmor ambassadors. So it's better to fight the common enemy. The bigggest reason for Skyrim to revolt is that Skyrim lives were lost defending the empire. Well,.if the empire had lost, Skyrim would definitely be next. AS that is the place of Thalos. Aldmeri Dominion would not have let them go.",

A prepared Batman, no 2000 Batmans can group together and work together. No other character has that freedom of working together.\n\nI think OP knows that as well, that's why he has given Batman the lowest number. Through numbers he has already given his opinion.",
    "The Operator from Witcher 2. Man it requires you to be at the top of your game. I found most of Witcher 3 fights to be way more easy in comparison. Even the frog.\n\nThe Operator I think was like Devs one day hanging out and saying what if we made like the hardest boss in the game really optional from one of the side quests and with shit loot. They'll troll so hard. And like damn, I loved that fight. I didn't do it for the loot. I did it for the fight.\n\nThat was the day I realised, teleporting mage with resummonable 2 tanks are an awesome combination. Had to use everything, Yrden for trapping the guardians, aard to force them away, quen, cause those mofo stone gargoyles and wizard hit like a truck. Igni to attack the operator before it teleports. The most difficult part of the fight hands down have to be the stone gargoyles. **HE RESUMMONS THEM**, so you can just keep attacking them and it will never end. So you need to just take attacks, slow them down or push them away to just get one hit to the Operator.\n\nReally fun fight. Best part, it's completely optional.",
