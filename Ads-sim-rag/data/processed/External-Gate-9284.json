    "but i think it is sad for her",
    "i should have been more care full \n\nthanks and have a nice day",
    "sorry now i feel embarrassed",
    "I am so excited for this!!!emote:t5\\_39tdz:12646",
    "I was talking about the miraculous show",
    "https://youtu.be/FoFWhtj6ipI?si=_QLap3zXa-0IKLiY\n\nYou will find it in first 1 minute of this video \nSorry I couldn't find a video where they only showed the light appearing.",
    "Learned something new!\nThank you \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Sorry this is a little philosophical.\nDon't have to take it seriously \n\ud83d\ude05",
    "Learned something new!\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Yes it is. But we still get so much attached to worldly things. Like how we are wasting our time in a fictional world developed by mankind.",
    "What is fax?",
    "Well.....\nI love the show is what I can tell you \nYou have put many details about how the show would have been more successful if they shortened the storyline.etc etc\n\nBut what I care about is why are they making Adrinette's relationship so lated progressed????\nI literally watch each ep by praying from the depth of my heart for them to get together. And to know their actual identities\n\nAnd the New York special was totally a hit for me\nSpecially how they danced together in the moon light floating in the sky \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97.\n\nBut in my opinion the reveal is what keeping the fans hooked onto the show. \nI am guessing that after miraculous writers get more interesting story ideas about the future they will keep the reveal on their bags and will just use it as their last resort. And after getting the story running with more supportive amounts of fans THEN they will through the reveal at us.\nI AM ACTUALLY DESPERATE FOR THE REVEAL.\nPLEASE PRAY FOR ME SO THAT I CAN CONTROL MYSELF \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Yes but wasn't their a light shown at the end of the special or in one of the eps or something?",
    "wow we meet again!\n\nwhat a small community.\n\n![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)",
    "well you do have a point their but it actually depends on the writers choice\n\nIf they want they can lead the stories towards any direction",
    "By the way\n\nI was reading your post and I really liked how you added \"\u2728\u00a0\" emojis  \nIt really forshadowed how excited you were.\n\nI mean I really could feel your excitement while reading\n\nI was awesome.\n\n![img](emote|t5_39tdz|12644)",
    "well i will say that it is a wishful thinking \n\nbecause if they make a wish then the would have to sacrifice something which the guardian wouldn't allow at all. and I would be lying if I said that I didn't match the concept of Nathenial's thinking about the reveal with Ladybug and Cat Noir. I too agree with Nathenial that it is wrong for them to not keep their powers after learning their real identities. \n\nBut it sounds too perfect for it to be happened in the actual story\n\nI mean which of us fans expectations were granted since 2015? (I am indicating the Ladynoir reveal Actually don't get me wrong)\n\nBut I am guessing that Astruct is just consoling us by indicating that something great is gonna happen with the reveal.",
    "well everyone has a hard past and through that people learn\n\nwith out a hard past people wouldn't learn and wouldn't grow \n\nthus character wouldn't be developed",
    "Thanks for the support I will try my best to make myself clear next time (perfect is what I mean) ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)",
    "maybe because she is not Lila  \nmaybe the writers are hiding a new plot twist about Ceries",
    "I totally agree with you. In conclusion Chloe's character was the one who refuses to change. And those who refuse to change will be replaced. I think it is a very good example the writers have introduced."
