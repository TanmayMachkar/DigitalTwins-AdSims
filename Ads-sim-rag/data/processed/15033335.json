    "Wow, first of all i would like to thank you for helping reduce abandoned cars on the road, Secondly, you practically answered my question in this thread with your insight thank you for that.\n\nMay i know where do you located seller who want to let go of their cars directly? Is it through personal group contact, facebook marketplace?\n\nAs i am planning to get a second hand car to commute in short distances.",
    "This is eye-opening for me. How long would a second hand car last for you on average ? And i know this sounds weird but do you guys fully use the cars until the end of life or do you guys continue the chain and sell it down as well",
    "Thank you for your answer , but lets say on average people take 5 years loan. Most cases the cars arent even up to the 5 loan maturity period but you already see less of them on the road",
    "Bro tell him nicely la, uncle your phone too loud can reduce volume ah? \nYou report here , we go find him and tell him?",
    "we WONT be watching this",
    "5K and want to earn 10K in a month?\n\nThats a 100% profit margin if you are excluding costs. Call me if you can make 100% profit margin, i also want to invest",
    "This guy gives sasuke a run for his money",
    "This isn\u2019t a race bro , \n\nThe thing about comparison is envy and envy leads to non logical thinking \n\nYou think his inheritance money is linear he gets 3% per year. You think he\u2019s not spending it? Or on the other hand , you think he\u2019s not investing it to make it more? \n\nWhy compare?",
    "Not a movie but Attack On Titan.\n\nPeak show with various twist that makes your mind go wtf?",
    "If the luck is that good, i'll take luck. With that amount of cash i presume 50 mil or a 100 mil wouldnt make as much a difference to a normal human like me as ill get to buy anything i want. I'm sure with extreme luck ill get to 50 mil at least through stocks , lottery , gambling etc. \n\nWith luck i wont be critically affected by life threatening events such as sickness, natural disasters, accidents.\n\nYou can get a 100 mil but die the next day from an accident.",
    "Nope, the seller just havent put the intended price yet.\n\nUsually shopee sellers will hike the price to exorbitant range. And then put a discount to his intended selling price to make the customer perceive it as a huge discount",
    "Hey if it is within your means, why not? You are only young once. In the future when there are more burdens and responsibility you wont find the thrill in buying a new car anymore.",
    "Just had lasik, i worse glasses for most of my life , give or take 15+ years. \n\nI still get the phantom glasses as i try to take it off now and then. But holy shit, what a relief to not wear glasses anymore, you can play sports, swim, wear sunglasses without prescription, even not get foggy glasses when you get out of a cold room.\n\nThe whole lasik operation took under 3 minutes for both eyes in total. And i was done for the day. Went back, went to sleep and woke up, looked for my glasses by my bedside table but i realized i could see now. \n\nThe only regret it why didnt i do this sooner",
    "Just remember this: \n\nBe predictable \n\nFor example , you see another driver on the road and you kinda know if he wants to turn into your lane or not, not that he curves slowly into your lane, that may cause an accident as well, as there are speeding motorcyclist",

    "Alright thank you brother. But do you mind elaborating on how is it why is my item cancelled? So in the future if i get sentences like this i can reply them. As you cant put this in google and translate it.",

    "Is it random or do i personally know the person.",
    "My power would be the power of decision.\n\nIn life we are always given decisions no matter how small or big.\n\nI will always pick the right decisions.\n\nFor example: There are 2 roads leading to home, i will pick one and it will be the fastest route home. I buy a lottery ticket with random numbers, the decision will be the most optimal one, might not be the biggest prize as it would attract most attention but a substantial one. Or even, picking the decision for a career path. I will always pick the most optimal decision which will be the most beneficial for me.",
    "That\u2019s what I said , it is by definition but not taxable.\n\nWhy are you so pressed \ud83d\ude05, I\u2019m in no way supporting the guy in the video above I\u2019m just talking about the definition of income. \n\nA quick google search and filtering it by reliability will show you the definition of income",
    "By definition it is income but not a taxable one",
    "It is income \nIncome is defined by receiving money \nWhat you are talking bout is employment \nBeggars are unemployed\n\nIf you find rm10 on the ground and pick it up , it\u2019s income \n\nA parents allowance is also considered income \n\nA government subsidy is an income",
    "Isn\u2019t that what a income is , you do stuff and you get money? \n\nYou get it from work , these people get it from videos, traders get it from profits?",
    "Imma keep it real with you \nHave u ever saw someone younger than you who don\u2019t act their age and makes you think like man I wouldn\u2019t act like that even at that age?\n\nYeah you sound like that right bout now",
    "Imagine being 30 but having the mindset of a young teenager.\n\nHave u on the off chance ever thought that they don\u2019t really give a fuck about you and they\u2019re just living life the way they like it",
    "The world is as hectic as it is, people find comfort in little things such as hot showers",
    "Man the guy cant even voice his own opinion.\n\nLets break it down, you guys as friends were talking about water heaters, he voiced his opinion and said that he feels comfortable taking a hot shower in the morning. And you called him a MF for that. \n\nI am not downplaying your frugality by any means or if you have a rougher upbringing. But that doesnt mean that someone else cant enjoy life by their means. \n\nThe guy might even be frugal but in other aspects.\n\nI know that the majority of richer people are snobbish but man on the other spectrum most people who live frugally are also insufferable. They have to tell you how frugal they live and you have to be as frugal as them. \n\nImagine the guy's parents had a rough upbringing and worked hard so his kids dont have to grow up in similar circumstances. This guy comes with the 'i dont have aircond so you cant have it as well'.",
    "Malaysians cant seem to complain enough,\n\nWhen the tree falls and fatally hits someone then they complain that the government doesnt do anything and just siphons money.\n\nWhen the government takes precautionary actions they also complain.",
    "Any major issue that you faced so far?",
    "Wow this guy thinks he's a snowflake for going against the majority and posting it online.\n\nSomeone give this guy a medal",
    "Casual first watch would be Pok\u00e9mon \n\nSerious watch was Yu Yu Hakusho",
    "Man the fishman arc was something else. You wouldve thought Luffy fresh outta training with Raleigh having learnt the basics of 3 hakis would wipe Hody and the pirates in under 5 mins alone. But its mad how they can stretch it to 50 episodes. They hinted Joyboy and the poneglyph but man they couldve done the arc in 5 to 10 episodes max.",
    "I cant watch 5 episodes back to back max if its pure padding. I salute you",
    "HXH is in my list, ive only heard good things about it. Will be watching it soon",
    "Exactly , you get my point. 15-20 mins isnt long if its midly interesting. But just 1 minute of plot which is crucial to the storyline and the rest of the 19 mins are padding is unbearable",
    "Im at episode 600 haha, ive invested that much, people are saying that i just have to endure a lil more",
    "I agree, the peak of One Piece according to fans is marineford. I admit there are a few good scenes but man that arc was good at best.",
    "They dont wanna admit it but its One Piece.\n\nSub-par story line, animation tanks most of the time, not much fillers but the padding is insane, asspulls, you name it",
    "Watch when the animation is crisp for one episode and becomes powerpoint slides for the rest of the arc until the end when luffy has his final fight of the arc",
    "At least she was upfront about it and didnt lead you on. Now you have a definite answer. It might hurt right now",
    "I\u2019ve tried but I have to hook my laptop and control it manually which bugs me. On my phone however, I usually will use my phone while watching tv as well",

    "Real question, why do people call Indonesia Konoha?",
    "Mark my words, \n\nThe one doing villainy is the void. Thunderbolts is going to be there to fight him. And realize he has the powers of a god. Somehow they're going to find out he actually has a split personality. And going to convince Sentry to subdue the void.",

    "Does punting a random annoying kid on the street make you feel better lmao , summore need wear hoodie, glasses, waste 1 hour bro come on get a life",
    "Bro why you need to have the 'best' everything.\n\nPewdiepie started recording on his phone and he became one of the biggest Youtuber OAT.\n\nStart with what you have first la\n\nOr else save budget get second hand first",
    "You're not doing it pal \n\n![gif](giphy|rmwIgrU9ZTqAQRzD34)",
    "Its for aesthetics, imagine seeing few guys walking down the street.\n\nOne guy is flabby head to toe\n\nAnother guy is skinny fat, where he has man handles showing from his shirt with small arms\n\nAnother guy who looks fit and has isnt excessively muscular, but you can see the tone of his muscles that he works out.\n\nAll 3 guys are average looking. If all 3 guys approach you, at face value most girls would reciprocate towards the 3rd guy based on aesthetics alone.",
    "This guy think he\u2019s a hero \ud83d\ude02",
    "Ive been saying this on almost 10 different anime recommendations posts, and ill say it in this one\n\nAttack On Titan",
    "That\u2019s what people always think to console themselves, there are people who are doing comfortably without breaking bank while earning a meager wage contractually. \n\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever heard of investing , not just so in stocks, but also in businesses",
    "By the way you phrase this statement, it shows that you are still immature and naive. How are you using your academic achievements to convince your parents on something that is totally unrelated. I might be wrong but the way your phrase your statement doesnt seem to show that your parents are unable to support your trip. \n\nI am not a parent. But if i was i wouldnt let you go seeing how naive you are. I could have a kid who is 2 years younger but is street smart and me fully funding the trip. Your parents know you well much better than anyone here. If they made that choice, they did not make it out of spite but pure parental instinct & judgement. \n\nA word of advice, unless you are going to be a specialist, a good grade won't take you far. There are Malaysians who never went to college/university but are earning big bucks. They are street smart with a quick wit and a fair sense of judgement. These kind of people are almost always the ones in control and pulling the strings.",

    "He runs grab 24/7 la mangkuk but not like his manager. Company directions, decisions, issue you think today think of one idea that means your company future proof already? Tomorrow another competitor release their app then how? Grab goes viral for the wrong reason then how? \n\nU say create SOP like make cake like that. You can create the most fool proof SOP, also people will find loophole one la. \n\nThere are so many layers in company structuring and management , but I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand. Don\u2019t talk until so far first la, go run a decent sized company locally and see how first",
    "What\u2019s stopping that ceo from opening his own business , since he\u2019s running from A-Z? He\u2019s getting all the experience , he knows the suppliers, customers, workers? He\u2019s running everything but only taking a minor stake?",
    "This guy gets it , they always think running a business is a get rich quick scheme. Like you said running a business makes you on your toes 24/7, because every implication , every decision right or wrong is UP TO YOU. Every issue in the company from top down is on you.",
    "Why do you think I\u2019m asking",
    "Thank you for this detailed explanation, just what i was looking for. I understand it now",
    "Sorry can you elaborate further on this, i am a totally new to the investing world",
    "Do you mind explaining further on how is doesnt work IRL",
    "How so, could you elaborate?",
    "Im gonna be honest, your car looking like that doesnt really help the mass consumers. The general public who buy second hand cars are looking for cars that has that standard look, slight modifications are fine. \n\nIMO if i was a buyer, in first glance i would think that this car is heavily used even if it wasnt. With it looking like this, you are practically cutting your consumer market by more than 50% as women, older people, working salaryman wouldnt buy a car that looks like this. Which you are left with are younger consumers & people who mod cars, which i would consider not a large market gap.",
    "Thank you for all your helpful replies fellow redditors.",
    "Pick up a team sport bro, be it basketball, badminton, futsal, you'll not only get fit but also join a community and meet new people",
    "Yes we kinda have the gist of it, you can get an estimate on how much someone\u2019s going to give based on his previous angpau\u2019s",
    "Arcane is a good one, most of the leading characters are female ie, Vi, Jinx, Mel, Caitlyn",
    "Yeah you are right, but it all boils down to financial capability at the end. I could go lower and cut costs, but every single aspect of my wedding was hand picked by both of us. In hindsight, the results from the wedding and the reception was more than satisfactory. Including my previous statement where i said we had to pick guests to be seated meticulously? We had a number of high profile guests that came to our party, these people have a keen eye on attires, jewelry, etc. As i said this was something of a social event. Both the bride and groom are the highlight of the night, as i am financially comfortable of it i would like my wife to go all out as you only experience your wedding once in a lifetime. Spending where we know its right but with the budget OP is stating, i would double check on what they are including",
    "Yeah bro if it was up to me , i would have just wanted a simple 10 table with closest friends and family. But for Chinese, wedding is actually a social event. You have to invite who's who just to give them face, and also you have to pick where each guests have to be seated meticulously. For example, there is a guest who gave me around RM20K, we kinda know it beforehand so he has to sit really really close to the front",
    "How is it RM500K for 50 tables bro, i just had my wedding 2 years back, a simple breakdown:\n\nWedding Dinner Including Hall Rental RM1588 per table for 45 tables(450 pax)=72K\n\nGown Rental (Pre Wedding Shoot Gown, Actual Day Bride and Groom)=10K\n\nPhotography Sessions Included for Pre Wedding, Tea Ceremony,Actual Day=10K\n\nBetrothal gift, tea ceremony, dowry (Include Food, Inviting Guests for Dinner one day before Wedding= Estimate 25-30K\n\nWedding Ring & Engagement Ring = 30-35K\n\nWedding Decoration Including Home, Car, Wedding Hall = 20K\n\nAd Hoc= 10K\n\nA rough estimate for me was 200K including everything, and i would consider my wedding to be expensive already. But we did not hire a wedding planner, we planned everything from day 1 to the wedding ourselves.\n\nEDIT: The angpau from the wedding dinner did cover the wedding dinner and more. So the damage after subtracting the angpau is floating around 110K",

    "My apologies for the vague information, this is my first time getting a car at this price range, have got alot to think about.\n\nI wouldn't be chauffeured around as most probably i will still be using my CRV to and fro work. In the case of the new car it would be mostly used for sunday drives / picking up suppliers and customers. \n\nPrestige/Status is required as the suppliers and customers i am dealing with are in the higher profile side. Maintenance costs wouldn't be an issue as my business projection backed up with previous years is on the healthy side.",
    "Thank you for the recommendations will look into these cars and also book test drives to have a feel of them",
    "Most Malaysians ? LOL\n\nThis guy never step foot overseas in his life if he's complaining about the living conditions in Malaysia.\n\nThis guy must be a fresh grad to say that Malaysia has terrible wages. Dont only look for job under aircond la, you are only a cog in the whole machine, doing one menial task repetitively for the rest of your life. Go find niche markets, i personally know people who earn mid 5 figures monthly.

None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?... They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them! And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us!

    "Decision Making\n\nThis is literally the one thing that dictates everything else. In life you are always given choices sometimes two, three, four choices. Among these choices, there is always the correct choice, the bad choice, the neutral choice. Sometimes you are aware on which choice is correct but you are held back emotionally and you choose the other way. Heck, even some wrong choices that you made wont be noticeable even after years.\n\nImagine this, your decision making is always correct. Which route to take to work, which stocks to buy, which commodity to invest, choosing the right ideas to expand your business, giving the right information to the right people. Compounding your correct decision making, heck you can even be the president if you play it right.",

    "Actually self made millionaires in Malaysia are abundant, it is because most Malaysians choose to turn a blind eye and its easier to excuse a younger chap driving a better car, bigger house, more successful career to having a rich family background. Sure most of self made millionaires in Malaysia can afford it but they choose not to get it, because they understand the difficulty in making every single cent and choose not too. Hence discounting them as not successful unless you know them personally. Look thoroughly, and you will see so many young people in their mid 30 earn their pot of gold from the internet boom, crypto boom, ecommerce. Heck some can earn millions doing outsource work overseas but staying in Malaysia. \n\nAnd on the topic of rich family background, can you blame them, if your father give you money, you dont spend?

    "It really is a high ceiling for a learning curve, but once you start getting a grasp of the basics, everything is easier to understand. \n\nWhen i started, Dota Cinema had these things called Hero Introduction for each hero. I dont know why watching a hero performing a skill is much more easier to learn than reading it for me. I watched every single hero and i started learning the mechanics. I wouldnt recomend watching it in 2024 because there are major changes to some heroes. But yeah i have around 1000 hours in and i am still learning to this day.\n\nGrasp the basics and literally just have fun. I would recommend playing turbo if you are a casual gamer. Gold and XP gains are 2X faster and also games end much faster. Playing a normal match after playing turbo is really draggy. Play with bots first and test different heroes to start out.",

If so do you think the government give them out to any and everyone? Bro make it make sense, they put themselves in that position to make themselves beneficial to the government for them to finance them.",

Or is it just 'something you heard from a friend of a friend'. Dont get me wrong, there are people like this, but mostly not to that extent. \n\nOh and that point about rich parents, wouldnt any one of us done the same? If you have rich and supportive parents, wouldnt you take that advantage? I mean this is what their parents work for is it now? To build a better future for their kids? Its like owning a car but choosing not to use it because everyone uses a bike, like for what?  No one chooses their parents.

Just by stating revenue doesnt really justify anything. There are good that are very high in price but low in margins and there are cheap goods that has a very big volume with high margin. \n\nAs i said 50% profit margin of 10 cents is 15 cents, which might no look like much but through compounding and volume it beats a product which is RM100 with 5% profit margin.",

    "Hi there, you are literally right.\n\nAs i have said before, there are loads of opportunities present in our homeland Malaysia. There are countless ways an average Malaysian can get money, you have online marketing (Instagram, Tiktok), globalization literally makes it super easy for anyone to get products from China, you can source items by a few clicks on your phone.  I am not saying that being the ultra wealthy is easy , it does take luck as well but being living comfortably is achievable. \n\nAnother fact is that Malaysia has one of the kindest people in the world. You can actually walk up to a Mak Cik by the roadside stall, and they would talk to you like you are their own son, talking about their day. Not only that people are actually willing to share knowledge if you ask the right questions and being socially inept knowing how to approach people. I have sat down with people from all economic backgrounds and chat with them and how they made their wealth. Its surprising how some make money, i know one who makes millions producing fishnet, yes fishnets. Do not let a few bad apples ruin the whole basket. You cannot find people like Malaysians anywhere else.\n\nComplaining does not do anyone good. Wealth inheritance is something no one can take control off. Comments here are saying everyone with a wealth inheritance also has a bad attitude, showing off their lifestyle. Heck, if anyone here had that they would too, could you blame them? But i also have friends who flaunt their wealth online but are the kindest and generous people ever. Everytime that i goes and stay over at his house, he demands that we must not pay even a single cent and that he has it covered even after insisting. He also always make a point to pay a few tens of ringgit to any beggars he sees on the street.",
    "I might argue, that working smart is also a major factor.\n\nImagine hiring 2 people to file paperwork. \n\nPerson 1: A hard worker, files it manually paper by paper does it 8 hours straight a day 5 days a week.\n\nPerson 2: A smart worker, uses a software to extract data and file it accordingly and does it within the hour.\n\nBeing a smart worker with inept problem solving skills really helps alot, as you are generally sought after more in the labor market, thus increasing your value and your salary in return.\n\nA prime example, a very controversial figure, Carlos Ghosn who literally turned Nissan around through his vision and implementation. He is does not work hard (screws the bolts on the cars, move inventory, transport goods).\n\nHe build his reputation by being a problem solver and the only person who can do it efficiently.",
    "You are right.\n\nBut 0.001% of 1% is less than 1%\n\nI am referring to 1% in general, not the top 0.001% specifically.",
    "Thank you for your input my fellow redditor.\n\nSpending where is necessary and providing yourself a more comfortable lifestyle, i really respect that.",
    "The keyword 'mindset'\n\nI fully agree on everything you just said. There are tons of opportunity in Malaysia to gain wealth, you can do literally anything and be well off, note well off not being ultra wealthy.\n\nA pasar malam fish seller tells me he can make around 30-40K a month by just selling fish. Heck if you are not planning to start a business, you can literally live comfortably by being a property agent, insurance salesman, etc. There are loads of opportunities here.\n\nSure there are people who inherit wealth but can you blame them, their parents got wealth by working hard, do you think they would pass it down to someone outside the family. That is what they are working for, to provide and make a comfortable living for their families. Just complaining about wealth inheritance is not going to do anyone good. That is why i really agree with ' hardworking and a positive mindset'",
    "I wouldnt agree with this, \n\n  \nBy this logic , you would have to set up a company, make sure cash flow sustains at a certain level and is sufficient to handle a number of employees to exploit.\n\n  \nI am not denying exploitation isnt real but you are talking about sweatshops level exploitation but i am talking about top 1% not the top 0.001%",
    "Finally, someone who understands. \n\nPeople always say that rich people migrate overseas. No offend but actually no. I have seen and know a handful of 1% in Malaysia and most of them dont actually migrate to another country. Most of the have their roots buried deep in Malaysia. Plus they know the ins and outs of our Malaysian economy, legislation, taxation. \n\nWhen i talk about the top 1%, i am talking about the ones who have a very very comfortable and good income in the range of 100K to a few millions a month. Most of the comments are talking about the top 0.01% which has listed companies, ties to the government with conglomerates etc.\n\nStarting a business in Malaysia is actually one of the easiest to go around, for example, there is shopee, instagram, tiktok. I have seen friends who saved up a few thousand ringgit in capital, sourced a few items from Taobao and literally rebranded it and took super good photos and videos of the items and sold it at a premium price locally here. Once your volume comes to a certain level, you can actually discuss with the factories in china to haggle the price , customize your own packaging, make custom items just catered to you.\n\n  \nThat particular friend on a good month makes 150-200K after 10 years through trial and error, making a good amount of money. But also do take into consideration his costs takes up around 50% of his revenue.\n\n  \nThe thing about being in Malaysia is you know the culture first hand and you know it quick. There are loads of opportunities here in Malaysia. Plus people are also very welcoming and supportive. Do not let a bad apple ruin the whole basket.",
