    "Luffy\u2019s body is literally made of rubber that he\u2019s whole thing he\u2019s a rubber man and me pointing out that sanji needs to help him is to show luffy can\u2019t just stretch his neck abovewater by himself, the zoan didn\u2019t allow him to transform into rubber he is always rubber even when he gets hit with haki attacks he\u2019s still rubber he just feels the actual pain of getting from the hit & it doesn\u2019t matter the type of devil fruit you have being submerged in water has the same effect on all devil fruit users, and you kept leaving out the part about them not being able to move or activate their abilities kuma needs to able to fire he\u2019s paws attacks off and him being underwater stops that from happening, and what is this head cannon your on about ? What makes you think kuma is water proof??? him being an android, he\u2019s probably the first to go down because he\u2019ll short circuit, in egg head the warlord copy\u2019s had artificial devil fruit and their build better by the same guy who changed kuma and THEY still suffer from devil fruit null when their put in sea prism stone bubbles, and I just don\u2019t think any of the warlord\u2019s would be able to escape the amount of water kisame can provides or kill him before he gets it off a 30% clone of kisame turned an intire land scape in to a river of water before team guy could react warlords can\u2019t get to the other side of the battlefield they notice what\u2019s going to happen exactly in any in closed area.",
    "Nice try again, devil fruit powers don\u2019t work under water luffy, body is rubber there\u2019s is no activation required, another example is brook when he doesn\u2019t just die instead because his body is under water be he suffers the same affects, in Kuma case he has to activate his devil fruit powers, which he can\u2019t because not only can\u2019t he used his abilities he also can\u2019t move his energy gets drained and their body\u2019s go limp as you remember luffy needed sanji to stretch his neck for him to breathe he still couldn\u2019t move until they got him out ninjas in one piece have nothing to do with ninjas in Naruto, kisame drowned killer bee same guy who reacted to minato\u2019s flying thunder god, but I still think it wouldn\u2019t matter kisame can just start fight flooding the area, it\u2019s not like kuma knows kisame can do this, for all he knows kisame is just your average fish man.",
    "Nice try kuma is already underwater no df, no haki no strength & mihawk can\u2019t wield kisame\u2019s sword it would attack him, his sword likes bee\u2019s 8 tails chakra specifically because sharks eat octopus",
    "That vista lvl threat nice try he\u2019s a hidan victim",
    "He was trying to kill whitebread and guess who stopped him lol vista with jozu support & plus why didn\u2019t he teach future sight to zoro if he wants a challenge and knows zoro is gonna fight him one day",
    "Nothing in his reputation refers to anything about him having or using future sight, you keep assuming when I asked you to prove it, you made your claim saying he has it now confirm he has it, with that logic I can just assume he dies next chapter because he might fight someone above vista lvl",
    "Nobody thinks that bitch is hot except one piece gooners, itachi fucks badder bitches any plus kisame there she\u2019s been delt with already",
    "I told you to prove it and you started assuming \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I can also assume shanks didn\u2019t use future against mihawk to make it fun they obviously wasn\u2019t trying to kill each other",
    "Right, what the difference between haki and chakra any ways there both a mix of spiritual,life and physical energy, hell if we verse equalization just straight up solos with his sword",
    "That vista lvl scrub couldn\u2019t handle any of the 7 ninja swordsman, kisame washing the paint of his sword plus can you prove mihawk has future sight and he definitely doesn\u2019t have conquerers",

    "Let\u2019s also not forget what he did to snake man, name another character that dodged his way out of a Gatling attack then tags luffy right in his nose, all right after he nerfs himself\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd9ikdnn201f1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddd2136493b440898004eaa22175990e061f10ac",

    "He beat guldo on king Kai\u2019s planet and vegeta said all the ginyu force members were stronger then he\u2019s earth version",
    "I\u2019m a go with lobo vs ghost rider, I didn\u2019t think the penance stare would have worked on someone like lobo and him being banned from the afterlife was supposed carry him to victory",
    "The scan you just sent doesn\u2019t say that, it says he uses the water in the atmosphere to impact the water WITHIN the opponent\u2019s body, that doesn\u2019t mean he can shoot water, make water constructs or submerge someone under water on LAND. If what you saying is true there would be no reason for him to do this:\nhttps://youtu.be/pxWBIQUdPgw?si=LN7eiror8xAEOz-5\nHe would have just grabbed water form the atmosphere and shot it instead getting a different source of water, all of jimbei water attacks especially  the larger ones only happens when he\u2019s under water \nOr has a supply of water, he\u2019s not like a water bender form avatar that can move water at will and make it do what ever he wants it to do, he has to be in contact with his water supply. It seems like you\u2019re also missing whole the point of me saying kisame can summon Oceans, he can instantly change the setting of any fight he\u2019s in and making it a fight underwater jimbei CANNOT DO THAT even if you\u2019ve assuming he shoot water blasts at people, he\u2019s never flooded his opponent and that the point about devil fruit users they can\u2019t swim, they lose their powers under water and it drains their stamina, jimbei and kisames powers are not the same the amount of water kisame can summon is in whole different league compared to jimbei and the best part is kisames don\u2019t need to be near any water he makes he\u2019s own. And like i said before you haven\u2019t proven jimbei use water in his fight with ace, you just keep saying he\u2019s near water, jimbei needs to be underwater to move large amounts, it wouldn\u2019t even make sense if it was true jimbei would have just fought him form the ocean he literally gained nothing form fighting on land yet the fight starts and finishes on land, and that steam your talking about doesn\u2019t appear on the panel when ace and jimbei finish fighting that dry land, The MIST comes with whitebreads ship as he approach\u2019s the island \nKisame(devilfruitusersworstnightmare) literally neg diffs whole power system in the OP verse",
    "WTF \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23Did you understand anything I wrote, I saying jimbei/any fishman CANNOT CREATE WATER and your response was to send me a picture of him saying admitting that he uses a already existing water in atmosphere to impact the water in your body meanwhile kisame(alphafishgod) can just drop entire oceans on your head with only 30% of his chakra so being that JIMBEL CANNOT CREATE WATER means he can\u2019t drown people on land like Kisame(supergigachadfishlord) \nI\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t manipulate water in saying he needs water to manipulate , your headcanon makes it seem like jimbei is out here water-bending like he be with water tribe at the northpole, in the fight with him and ace you not only is water never shown (you can\u2019t even point out the ocean your headcanon is relying on) but we see plenty of fire coming off ace and non of it gets extinguished by water of any kind But if we keep playing the head canon game id just say jimbei couldn\u2019t get ace in the water, he couldn\u2019t grab him he\u2019s a logia or jimbei wasn\u2019t trying to kill him he just wanted him to fuck off.",
    "Like I stated before even if i agree to him make enough water to fill his hand, which you still haven\u2019t prove and I\u2019ve already gave plenty of examples of jimbei not being able to make water and having to ether use a substitute liquid or finding someone who can make water, your still comparing a broken to an entire ocean\u2019s worth of water lol \nAnd You still don\u2019t see the ocean you can\u2019t even see the bottom of the Moby Dick if they where right next to shore you would still see the ocean under the boat instead it\u2019s just more land with trees it more likely there on a cliff not a beach/shore line plus I still see no indication of water being used, no water on the battlefield, no steam in the air not environmental damage done by water just more head cannon, if we playing the head cannon game I can just say there both fighting for 5 days straight, how we know they didn\u2019t just move closer to the ocean at the end of the battle and they both passed out before jimbei could use it",
    "Kaido has never heard of or even fought someone who can bring entire oceans to fights and you think he just \u201cfigure out\u201d kisame is gonna flood the area or summon moving ocean on land ? lol my point about him being drunk is show what he would do in character based on previous fights he\u2019s had, he doesn\u2019t just turn into a dragon of jump in every single fight the first thing he does stand there and tanks the first hit, that\u2019s how he got chin checked by luffy red roc while watching run at him with a giant red fist on the rooftop but no I guess one look at kisame and kaido\u2019s heart downs and he instantly locks in because he knows he might die in the next move\ud83e\udd23",
    "That wouldn\u2019t happen if the island is under water first, if there in character kaido\u2019s first instinct in battle isn\u2019t to turn into a dragon it\u2019s to stand there and try and aura farm thinking he can just tank any attack if he\u2019s not already drunk of he\u2019s ass, the first thing kaisame does in all he\u2019s fights is full it with water. Kaido would drown before he even realizes his opponent isn\u2019t one of these average beta fishman who splash around water.",
    "It doesn\u2019t come from the air if you watch the fight his hands are wet and it\u2019s not even like he has a hand full of water it literally looks like he just dunked his hand in water or wiped off some sweat \n\nhttps://media.tenor.com/cBwJfsOO498AAAAM/jinbe-jimbei.gif \n\nAnd even if that was the case, you\u2019re comparing someone who can make a hand full of water to someone who can instantly change landscapes like what are you talking about? When he fought ace he was nowhere near the ocean he was the middle of island surrounded by ace\u2019s old crew, This actually crazy because I had to double check and make sure my I was seeing it right but in the short fight flash back the only sign of water is the sweat coming of jimbei, ace and his crew, no puddle of water, no signs of water damage on ace, there isn\u2019t even any steam that would indicate the jimbei is clashing water attacks against ace\u2019s fire.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SHizfQsbvHk?si=Ve1zUFCxNV-9zCdH",
    "No he can\u2019t jimbei has to be in or touching water to manipulate it, in whole cake he countered kats mochi attack with a near by cup of tea if he can just make water why would he need to use it ? In impel down there solution for getting to marineford was to have jimbei attack the raft underwater too shoot them upwards, in Wano when onigashima was burning down and about to explode jimbei spent 2 chapters looking for raizo to summon water for him, hell one of the first fish man we see in arlong park, the fish man who lost to usopp  main form of attack was sucking up water form near by ponds and spitting it out, FISHMAN CANNOT MAKE WATER meanwhile kisame\u2019s 30% chakra clone turned a forest into an sea with one attack. to jimbei, kaisame is a fishgod",
    "Kisame would floods whatever island there on",
    "No if he\u2019s already under water",
    "One piece Stans hate it when you remind them that there favorite character is one bath away form death",
    "because jimbei can\u2019t summon large amounts of water like kisame can jimbei has to use what ever water that\u2019s available to him",
    "It\u2019s different because jimbei can\u2019t summon large amounts of water like kisame can jimbei has to use what ever water that\u2019s available to him",
    "Nah he\u2019s definitely losing to kisame",
    "When did luffy or kaido get hit with an attack that split the moon in half",

    "How are you liking naruto so far ?",
    "First thing that popped in my head was Bleach",
    "1.Just because it\u2019s in a Reddit forum or a cbr list doesn\u2019t mean is not true you have to look at the evidence they provide, even if you don\u2019t believe them then you can just look for statements made by the author, there\u2019s a data book statement the say \u201csealed inside naruto is a powerful force that can turn world to ash\u201d and that was at the earlier stage of shippuden \n\n\n2. Being a planetary threat doesn\u2019t mean you have to destroy it in one single attack. It the capability of destroying a planet for example If I had an attack that can destroy 1/3 of the world and I can use it 6 times in a row I would be more then planetary \n\n\n\n3. Your logic is basically \u201cif I never saw it happen, then it can\u2019t happen\u201d, which is flawed, by your logic goku, gohan, piccolo or cell can\u2019t destroy a planet either because they\u2019ve never been seen doing so and beerus must not be planetary either because we\u2019ve only seen him destroy half a planet with one attack. Hell I can even show how flawed that logic would be if you used in the real world. I\u2019ve never seen air and the people telling that air exists are just regular people making claim just like you and me so for all we know air is a made up thing too.",
    "But you made the claim: \u201cNaruto is NOT and will NEVER be planetary\u201d that would put the burden of proof on you to prove he hasn\u2019t reached that level by your own logic I\u2019d be the non believer and you\u2019d be the one suggesting something void and silly plus it\u2019s not hard to prove that he is planetary just a few google searches, and some reading and it would be hard not to come to that conclusion that he\u2019s at least planetary",
    "What makes you think he\u2019s not planetary? Even better question if you haven\u2019t read one piece how do you know naruto can\u2019t solo?",
    "So you think one piece characters are planetary but not naruto ??",
    "No, rock lee is not a wasted character he simply peaked after the drunken fist. There\u2019s not much you can give someone who can\u2019t use ninjutsu or genjutsu.
