    "Itachi was confronted with war from a Young Age thus why he later wanted to protect the Peace by any means \nAnd he had the Choice between a war outbreak and keeping the peace and choose to do what had to be done \nIf anyone is to blame on the Situation than it\u2019s Hiruzens old Ass for not Intervening in Danzos make Konoha great again business \nAlso in the filler episodes Minato was waiting in the  toilet line while Naruto had to poop \nSo unless smth. is cannon it doesn\u2019t matter \nBtw. I also think that if Minato where there it wouldn\u2019t have happened because he wouldn\u2019t let Danzo do stuff like Hiruzen allowed him \nAlso Itachis reasoning for favouring Sasuke is that the Uchiha have such strong emotions especially for the people they care and love and Sasuke was Itachis most Important person \nAlso he can\u2019t be held accountable for Sasuke choosing to attack the village because he implemented the Kotoamatsukami in Naruto as a save mechanism for Sasuke \nWhen you say he was stupid or naiv what do you think should he had done instead",
