    "I hope its not another powerpoint presentation like tbate",
    "Gacha games. People battled on the hill of pay2win just for a single generation ruining it by diving head first into one of the most predatory abusive gambling pay2win franchise ever made. The temptation of anime tiddys was to strong.",
    "Good that i have no desire for it since hearing they removes glory kills.",
    "I remembee the second season ending with him in another world again. Please tell me he comes back and we are not gonna have one of those \"we completly flip the setting/plot halfway through the show\" moments.",
    "Stay at your House.",
    "I never got why people go so feral for GTA. Games where always kinda mid at best for me.",
    "Infusioncenter",
    "I will never applaud devs for letting players make stuff that should have been in the game in the first place. \n\nLike its cool that they let them, it would have been cooler had they done a better job at their Job so players dont have to do it for them.",
    "First of all i will always point out when Players and modders do a better Job then developers do. Giving players the budget version of the tools you use and have them to better work then you is not something to be applaudet for. Otherwhise bethesda would be the best studio in the world. My mindset is always if i need to mod a game for it to be good, then there is something inherently wrong with the game that the devs should have done better to begin with.\n\nSecond even within the frames of the things they do Sabre has already done a poor job. The Salamander beeing on the Sniper Class, the laughable amounts of Cosmetic rewards earnable through the ingame achievements and thats just the cosmetic part without talking about all the other stuff that hasnt been so great.\n\nAnd third i do have a PC i just prever getting high quality from the devs itself and not having to bother with mods.",
    "Jojo did irrepairable damage to the Anime fandom.",
    "Yes exclusivly so.",
    "Its kinda sad how mutch better this mod is then what a AA company can produce.\n\nI was realy excited to grind many hours in this game but the cosmetic rewards are so pathetic i cant be asked.",
    "Thats the neat part, you dont. You just keep ir growing till you have a majestic beard like dumbledore or Merlin.",
    "I never got the Hype behinde GTA.",
    "Demonslayer",
    "Why are you showing me 2 power point presentations?",
    "Ouh yeah we do. They are still terrefieng.",
    "Selber grund warum so abfall wie horoskope, kartenlesen, heilsteine ect erlaubt sind. Weil manche leute einfach f\u00fcr ihre dummheit blechen sollten.",
    "A chimp is already twice as strong as the average adult male and has sharp teeth. So yeah.",
    "Listen i'm doing a thorek kampagne currently and i saw what that \"caster\" dwarve did to that rat in melee. The bottom pic seems accurate.",
    "Nobody argues the gorilla cant be beat with wrapons as depicted up above. The original scenario was 100 naked dudes with nothing but their fists against the gorilla which is the key factor here. Cause without weapons we would never have hunted mammoths or other large prey.",
    "Dis is da wae. Best meme shall neva die.",
    "One Piece has been going to long and if they would stop branching of to a sideplot every 50 episodes the show would have been over 600 episodes ago at the latest.",
    "Does changing the start position change he campaign victory goal?",
    "It had potential and the idea of a Mage game was cool.",
    "Why build my own if the perfect one is already there? Rias Gremory is litteraly in the Meme!",
    "The show is Black Butler. As for the eye, its a symbol marked by a Devil he has a contract with. The more obvious the placement of the Mark the more powerfull the Devil becomes in return and so ciel sacrificed his eye to make his servant as powerfull as he could.",
    "Bro thinks gorillas in Zoos and shelters represent the average behaivor of gorillas in the wild i litteraly cant explain how wrong the statement of gorillas not knowing how to fight is.\n\nThese animals playfight from the moment they can walk and later on in life to defend their terretory against other gorillas or predators.\n\nBut lets assume the \"dumb animal\" is just swinging its arms around. A single hit from those and your bones are broken. A punch from a Human(speaking of the average human here btw not fucking eddie haul. The double world champion of strongest man alive is not a standart that should be applied here) does not do any meaningfull damage to a gorilla. It would be like a toddler punching an adult.\n\nPeople think every human is some world champion special forces super soldier trained and coordinated in killing while the reality is most people out there dont know how to throw a punch properly. The gorilla also doesnt need to kill you an animal will fight to the death while most humans would shit themself like children when they see a bone sticking out of her arm or leg.",
    "Makima. As the control devil shed keep me alive cause cant control dead people. :>",
    "And you think it will just let you?",
    "Your assuming that a 100 naked dudes charging at a gorilla exhaust the animal enough to a point where it litteraly cant move anymore. I have a bad reality check for you: That thing needs to land about one hit per person to either kill or incapacitate a Human. About half the humans will be dead meat before the 15 minute mark."
