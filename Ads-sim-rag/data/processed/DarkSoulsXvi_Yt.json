    "Glock-9 : A bullet an eye",
    "Me.",
    "Green lantern ring would work wonders if I had the brain of Batman, \nSpeed Force is OP but I don't want to see the world in slow motion.\nI'll choose Omnitrix. It's balanced, multiple different types of aliens allowing for a diverse plethora of abilities to choose from, and if you make friends with the other 2, you can pretty much rebuild the universe.",
    "Given Americans, you can never be sure.",
    "Sleepy Mita wouldn't notice",
    "Yes.",
    "Apparently someone is making a fan continuation and ig they would incorporate that",
    "In that case, you should just title it \"Wu-jin and what happened to him\" or something. Ah well, but tbf, when I'm watching a show I try not to look it up on youtube or reddit before finishing to avoid spoilers because it's bound to happen anyways.",
    "Takes away a lot tbf.",
    "Personally didn't see the dub because I liked the Japanese voice better but I'll try it sometime",
    "Would definitely be an interesting mashup.",
    "Didn't the comics do that?",
    "One day, brother, one day.",
    "Yes but I think she's slowly embracing her other side. A lot of that was for Jun and it seems he likes her either way so yeah.",
    "I think Tomo-chan has made me into tomboys a bit.",
    "How do I lock my pointer? \n\nSo basically, I use the MS Store app. Some games are there which make me move the mouse a lot in either Up/Down/L/R direction. But when i got down the taskbar pops up which causes issues while playing games. i want it to lock so this doesn't happen.",
    "I knew it was you from the second I saw that skeleton",
    "Never thought I'd really be too hard into tomboys and I don't think I am but tomo in particular is something.",
    "Wow, this is quite the list. Happy Birthday!",
    "Ik that's not what you were watching",
    "Probably between 27-56",
    "I'm going to reverse the phrase \"never ask a woman her age \" here.",
    "Oh wow I guess this show really has a community of all ages, that's nice.",
    "The name.",
    "Offtopic but by any chance, would you mind telling me what you have to do with the shotgun?",
    "Apparently the show was based on a play.",
    "I guess it would be. I'm guessing it must be better than a lot of other shows though I haven't watched any others.",
    "Maybe they could've shown that to show their desperation and them trying to survive (only for a short clip) but it'd be pointless. Large amount of energy lost for so little. Birds are hard to catch anyways.",
    "Gwi-nam being a hambie doesn't really play too much of a role here, given Na-yeon and the archer guy. But maybe...",
    "Yes but, I personally feel like I have closer attachments to shows than others. Most of my friends just watch movie after movie, sometimes they don't even know the lore upto what theyre watching, they're just watching it like it's shorts. After watching a show, I don't watch another one usually for atleast 3-4 days so that I can absorb it fully.",
    "Lol tbf with you, back then I was just annoyed  because my phone couldn't run the game and everyone on Discord was absolutely clowning on the game after its release so I just seized the opportunity.",
    "I don't know man, I don't think 1 inch of an expired chocolate bar has enough to keep me running.",
    "Yk what, I agree with all your points. \ud83d\udc4d",
    "Prob casino",
    "Fair, maybe the show directors didn't think about it? I'm assuming they hunt based on the smell of living beings and avoid corpses (other zombies) . Being the way they are, they should just about be aggressive to anything that moves. Like male elephants in musk (they will quite literally attack anything they see for no reason at all and are highly dangerous).",
    "Yeah. Think about it if you were in that situation. You have no clue if she's good or not, she's joining forces with your mortal enemy, she avoids all possible contact with you guys, and also your friends are just like \"she's in danger, we need to help her\" for no reason.",
    "Yeah but can you go days with little to no water and still have the energy to drop kick zombies?",
    "Yeah things like this are what keep me going. I loved this show for the first few eps but things like this keep, yk.",
    "Yeah it cuts out the realism and immersion you get into the show when you realise it.\n\nNo food is okay, you can survive three works but surely you wouldn't fight at full strength, right? You probably wouldn't be drop kicking zombies left and right whether or not you're an athlete, right? But my current assumption is that they just are running on that kind of adrenaline that they, without food, manage to hold their own as 3 people against hordes of raging zombies that bleed testosterone. Nothing else makes sense.",
    "Yeah, people keep forgetting that because we know she had good intentions. Think from Sammy's perspective.",
    "Ye, also the show did keep mentioning how the virus keeps evolving each time so what if he's a different kind of hambie? An evolution from Gwi-nam. An evolution from Nam-ra.",
    "Given the current theory of fear response that I'd assume most people can agree on would make some sense in the show, Cheong-san's two last moments were not quite fear. Sure, he was scared. But also, one thing I noticed with the other members who died is that they essentially, gave up. What I mean is how when  Jeon-young (I think, the glasses guy) died, he gave up. So did On-jo's father in his last moments, despite their last response not quite being fear entirely. Cheong-san in the last scene we see of him was more concerned with taking down Gwi-nam and getting to safety.",
    "No yeah it does seem like she's selfish but tbf, imagine if one of your closest friends pretended they died, then after chasing them across the globe you finally find them and they leave you to be with a person who runs one of the world's largest underground dinosaur rings and trafficking organisations. And then all your friends are like \"yeah but she's in danger, we have to help her. Why? Idk, we just have to\" that was basically Yaz. She really didn't put forth any good argument for why she's doing it.",
    "Yes, also the scientist did mention that higher temperatures activated the white blood cells to fight harder against the virus ;)",
    "I agree with what you have said. To add to it, today I read someone else mentioning something about the director having plans for Cheong-san, so whether or not it expands his story further into the past or continues with the timeline is unclear, but I'd assume its the latter so, yeah, Cheongsan's return is practically confirmed. Or so we can say it is.",
    "Ik I'm one year late, but based on what the scientist said, and based on the theory, I think it's based on a will to survive. The entire virus exists because there's a will to survive that's so strong that they'll keep rising up no matter how many times you stab and injure them. Gwi-Nam in his last moments, all he wished for was to get revenge. Namra, idrk tbf, maybe her only goal was to save Su-Hyeok but you're right, it's similar to On-jo's father who was also concerned about the survival of his daughter but he still turned. Maybe it's all about vengeance. A purpose to survive. Their willpower so strong they keep fighting and keep getting up. Idk about Nam-ra but this would make sense for Gwi-Nam, Eun-ji and Cheong-san. They all must've had some or the other reason to survive. If Cheong-san didn't want to survive, he wouldn't have ducked from the nuke. But yeah, it's tough. It's definitely got some holes.",
    "Ah, wish we could do that. In my school we can't do anything remotely close.",
    "They all have different coats.",
    "Why not make a guess for now ah? \ud83d\ude05 Let's see how strong these guys are for fighting so many off after 4 days of no food, and water. Lmao i gass out after 30 mins",
    "Ah I see.",
    "Late comment, sorry but I think I saw Ms Park in one of the scenes as a zombie. Atleast I saw her shirt.",
    "Cheongsan's left eye, how do you feel right now?",
    "I'm pretty sure I remember seeing her as one of the zombies walking around in one of the scenes outside, the part where mi-jin and the archer sis jump out of their little hiding spot after the helicopter brings the zombies to them",
    "That means that Cheong-san is likely a halfbie ( why does everyone call them hambies? I watched the English version and they called them halfbies. Was it not the case in the korean original?) too since other than bleeding from his nose, he didn't really show any other signs of turning. He called over zombies",
    "I definitely think Cheong-san and Gwi-nam had to have survived. It's possible the floor they fell to was underground (Idts since I remember seeing light from the floor they were in) or that they used the other zombies to cover themselves. Gwi-nam after being saved, may turn loyal to Cheong-san.",
    "Are you sure about this?",
    "Zombies are better",
    "Seven?? Do you know the exact count of how many zombies are there by now?",
    "Tbf, it's stupid that these theropods are even attacking sauropods and leaving  unharmed in the first place. It reminds me of that documentary clip where the argentinosaurus fucking stomps a Mapusaurus, that's what I expect to happen when something like the Giga tries having a nip at a brachi.\n\nJW has really put shame to their name.",
    "That would be the only logical way to do it, I suppose.",
    "Goddamn those are almost as big as her jaw",
    "Yeah, like if the company had invincible robots and drones that can control dinosaurs, they might as well have just sold those to military organisations for huge sums of money. Those fucking Terminator ones would make mean bodyguards and the drones could be great tools to escort prisoners and criminals without having to interact with them.",
    "Theri needs a moment. The theri scene was one of the best in dominion and he truly did bring back the original horror essence that the movies had lost.",
    "To do that, they'd need him to have the ability to trick humans, and hunt down sauropods for sport. Like he'd need to singlehandedly bring down his entire ecosystem down by himself, killing everything in his sight just because he can, destroying everything in the process.\n\nThe indominus was the sole reason for the failure of the entire Jurassic World park, I just don't see the giga going around doing even half of what he did given how he was in Dom. Unless they were to completely retcon the dominion giga.",
    "How did you even find this post?",
    "What instagram reels does to a mf",
    "We saw her fight in the S3E10",
    "Yeah but the difference between 27 and 30 isn't quite the same as 16 and 18.  Once you're in your twenties, being 23 or 24 makes no difference but whether or not you're  17 or 18 does.",
    "Maybe so, but creators like that can also have fans as old as 17.",
    "Lol I saw another guy whose account is almost as old as me",
    "After reading gdemon's comment on impractical jokers, I was just reminded of the time Henry Cavill walked through the streets and no one recognized him. Most people would probably not notice them just walking across the street unless it's super obvs",
    "Tbf, she is probably a lot more mature than him but yeah it was definitely something",
    "Pushing 18? How? IIRC, The entire event of CC took place within 6 months. Meaning Kenji would at most be 16. Brooklynn would be 14. Now the whole 15 vs 13 thing is upto you guys but he wasn't pushing 18.",
    "If so then I'm pretty sure he's only 1 or 2  years older than  Kenji. Meaning that he was probably 16/17 at the time of JWCC.",
    "Honestly when I first saw the walkthrough, when ugly mita didn't rat you out to crazy, I thought she was saving you either cuz she wants to help you or wants to use you.",
    "Both?",
    "This guy man \ud83d\ude02. Hope they give you some sort of marketing position for all this marketing you're doing",
    "From what I've heard, the acting crew all thought the same. They were only informed that the show was ending on S5 like 3 weeks before it aired. Apparently the writer just randomly lost interested and wanted to move on so he just stopped it there and then.",
    "We can see that it's clear how those two deal with things in the show from the way they interact with each other, so that makes sense. Jung did say something about the store to indicate it was his first time since \"his incident\" which was when we was 15/16 , yeah he's a shitty father. Heard from someone else on here that in the original play, they said something about him beating Jung's ass so hard he got sent to the hospital.",
    "And I don't mind that because they aren't going to fucking send it under every comment of their comment section. At this point why don't you go send it to everyone's dms to make sure they got the message, huh?",
    "Idk man.. there was a certain other girl in this series that tried that and, oh boy, you wouldn't believe me if I told you but.....",
    "The main characters have a special ability, it's called plot armour. Didn't you see? I get why they do it but it is obvious. They escape the jaws of a dinosaur by milliseconds almost every episode since CC. \nI still remember seeing the indominus rex waterfall scene from JW. That shit definitely made my heart skip a beat back then because it never got that close. I was also 9 back then  so yeah but still, this show doesn't exactly give off that much fear but it still does pretty well I suppose.",
    "Bro the amount of times you keep plastering the same image is kind of making tired of seeing this title card lol",
    "Or, If I recall correctly but yes",
    "Tbf, how tf would she even be featured in a movie about Isla sorna? She's on nublar and has been featured in every movie and show that takes place on Nublar or relates to it.",
    "Pretty sure it's a she.",
    " the synopsis given by the official JW channel said that \"all the dinosaurs living outside the required conditions died out and only the ones who lived in similar climatic conditions to that of the original islands survived\".\n\nThat's probably referring to the events post-Dominion.",
    "JWCC and JWCT",
    "Tbh I was waiting for them to reveal that he was the little girl's dad and this is the work he'd been doing 'in the city' since s2 started",
    "Like they were trying to FORCE the fights between him and his dad even when there was no good reason",
    "You took the words right out of my mouth!",
    "Idk man... Last I recall, BigFoot wasn't 5'5",
    "And she is....",
    "r/neversaynever",
    "Oh come on, Godzilla has crazy tough skin and shoots fucking laser beams out of his mouth, what the hell is she gonna do? Try and go for his neck? Lmao",
    "Yeah, funny enough, it's 6:10 AM rn. Started at like 12 AM.",
    "Yeah he gets worser to the end. I don't think you should stay on this sub much till you finish S5. That's what I did. I just finished it like 30 mins ago lol",
    "That would add a lot more context.",
    "It's been a couple days since i watched S1 but if IIRC, Janet didn't exactly deny anything. I dont think he's too strict or anything but they do give more importance to Jung at times, ignoring her.",
    "Honestly, IIRC his character from S1 was better",
    "Jung towards the end, seems to be starting almost all the fights. \n\nAfter hearing about Simu's disappointment about the showrunners  not letting Jung get any growth, it sucks honestly. I can see why he was pissed.",
    "I think the problem is that the show keeps shifting between flirting and platonic chatting almost seamlessly. Gerald and Janet's kiss, for example, was really out of the blue. Jung and Shannon's kiss was also really out of the blue. They had better moments to do it where they had more chemistry but for some reason they chose the scene where they were just chatting in a friendly way and all of a sudden, kiss for no reason.",
    "19/20.\n\nForgot Janet's teacher's name.",
    "You think a grizzly is tanking an atomic beam???? \u2620\ufe0f",
    "I think her having lost an arm probably inspired the writers to do that",
    "Yeah, you're right. Looks like Skar King riding on Shima as a hidden hint",
    "Maybe. Could just be his dorsal fins but i can see the eyes argument",
    "You mean scar king?",
    "I'm guessing somewhere around fall this year.",
    "Are you saying theri won't attack because it's blind? I doubt the theri won't smell you or better yet, hear the giga snoring, gets aggressive and on its way, yeets you out of the window.",
    "Theri as far as I remember is highly territorial, might just be even more aggressive than the godamn Indominus for all I care.",
    "I'd like to see you do that for 8 hours.",
    "With the allo beside, I think you'd probably die either way. Just as a twig they step on while fighting.",
    "2. Hopefully, Owen Grady will be sitting at 3 to take care of both the Spino and the Dilo.",
    "Hey friend, got a dollar?",
    "I remember reading a comment where they said they wished Gia died so Benji would become a thing. Could be sarcastic but yeah",
    "Bro these L/G shippers just be pulling shit out of their ass i swear",
    "Wait.. you sure? I haven't deleted it yet even though I haven't played it in 4 months, because I didn't want to lose it.",
    "The wiki states that he is a male",
    "I meant Nonna. I don't know Smoothie's gender.",
    "Yessir.",
    "Yes. She loves him.",
    "Id hope so. So far, CT has been very nice when it comes to showing other dinosaurs I guess. or to an extent. We did get Majunga, Bary, Sucho, etc. in CT 2 and in CT 3, They showed a lot of the same dinos shown in Dominion's first part so I'm guessing CT 4 would be similar. \nTho I'd like some extra diversity in there too.",
    "Yes.",
    "They did say more were made + it's possible.",
    "Soyona trusting her could be attributed to the moment B saved Soyon's life letting the Scientist die. Maybe that's the moment Soyona thought that she passed the test.",
    "I forgor \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd74",
    "Oh yeah... Forgot about that part!",
    "Indominus rex X Raptor Pack but yeah demon is not as smart as the indo was",
    "Otp?",
    "Could've told us more about her. Theories were there that she was cloned or made in a lab.",
    "It's very likely they will. The point of their fight was B and she's back with the crew again. I think she'd make amends with Sammy and Sammy would apologize to Yaz for not hearing her out and vice versa.",
    "0, 0",
    "In a way, yes. It's annoying for me personally when I'm trying to find school related videos and 70% are in hindi. But yeah, i got used to it by using the subtitles (for some reason, on pc there's an auto translate feature that's not there on my phone) and mainly pay attention to the writings which are in English",
    "Miguel fan here, I thought everybody would be pissed over the fact that Robby lost his chance again given how people's opinions were after Pt 2. They all got their own good endings.",
    "So they change it?",
    "But isn't that their pride? The father, mother and son",
    "Phone still runs most things without a problem at all. Have dropped it many times and the most that's been broken were the easily replaceable screen protectors. It may lag on higher end games nowadays like Genshin Impact or the new Ark (can't run) but other than that I have practically no complaints with this phone.\u00a0",
    "Poco M3 user here, my phone still works fine after 3.5 years. It had some software issues here and there but they got fixed in later MIUI. Currently my phone has another software bug which is kind of annoying but only comes every once in a while. I don't think that one will get fixed because I don't think I can update past MIUI 14 but ye",
    "1.Maybe you should also consider reading the entire thing through because I just did and I'm not seeing much\u00a0 anywhere stating that it was my personal opinion.\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are to use the analogy you used then it would be :\n\n\n\"I'm no athlete but I've been seeing a lot of comments by people in the fitness community saying that X athlete doesn't seem to be in good shape / is on too much roids. What's your opinion on the matter? \"\u00a0\n\n\n2. Your analogy is kinda off. Being fat and judging an athlete's performance is more like being a hypocrite but if the athlete is required to have a certain physique and they don't. People can comment. You don't go around asking people who comment on terrible fighters\u00a0 / fighters who are not exactly in their prime \"why don't you go fight in the ring with them then\"\u00a0 Do you?\u00a0",
    "Actually I can't run the game on my current device unfortunately so I couldn't even if I wanted and I have a huge exam coming up in the next 2 months so I won't get to play till then but yes eventually I will get to use a phone that is better so I will of course be trying it out. I also saw notifications from YouTube saying that they fixed all the lag and bugs and if you ask me, that's pretty good, given it's only been 2 days and they said updates will be slowly rolling out.\u00a0",
    "I don't think it's just features, people are complaining about purchase issues (it seems they have done something to resolve that or are trying to), then there's the compatibility, optimization, lack of settings, bad controls, etc. Though I can't comment on these\u00a0",
    "I mean it is an opinion of some on the discord server, I've seen people say they should just scrap the entire project and return to old ark so people definitely are not happy with this ark but there are also good reviews so it seems mixed",
    "I've heard complaints from people with good hardware as well though. Also genshin impact is a game that is really demanding but runs smooth on many of these incompatible devices.\u00a0",
    "That's actually a really good point\u00a0",
    "Good phone but doesn't run",
    "It's possible, I have the same case as well but I was losing hope I could because my phone didn't meet the requirements some people here said is required. But I don't think it matters because GSG has currently confirmed that some 8900 devices can run ark and there's a high chance yours and mine are in that.\u00a0",
    "Expected release date says 18th December and the devs don't seem to be trying to lower expectations. Either way it's definitely within this week so at max I'd say 22",
    "Idk bro you should still give it a shot, check out GP's latest video on YouTube.\u00a0\nThe expected release date by apple is tomorrow, and they don't seem to be trying to change any expectations and it's possible play store will get the same date so maybe we'll get it tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso something that increased my hope was that they said \"Some Mali phones could preregister while some couldn't\" Also they said they have confirmed 8900 devices that can run ark and so it's very likely you can play it, don't lose hope yet bro\u00a0",
    "From what I've heard, Mali can't run well but hey man, keep hoping, my phone might run it might not let's see. Though I would suggest seeing if you can find any phone that's not Mali\u00a0",
    "Funny to see we're both quite close in age lol, I'll be 18 next july.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately I may not get to see Part 3 when it drops cuz this is my final year of high school (big deal where I live) and I gotta lock in before my finals on 21st but yeah it is what it is",
    "Damn. Can't imagine what you're feeling.. I only started this show back when s4 or s5 came out (I think it was s4) and that was in 2021/2022. And heck, I feel nostalgic seeing edits of this show of which I saw clips from merely 2 years ago.. And I wasn't even that attached, I did like the show and all but I wasn't obsessed. I don't watch many shows so this is one of the few I've ever watched.\u00a0\nI'll miss it and I bet you do 10x as much.\u00a0",
    "Yeah I see that now. But he's definitely not where he was considering he was being treated as an equal to Miguel and Robby who were holding their own against their respective rivals in the brawl. He's closer to demetri level now but he looks to have performed better than Sam in the platform battle.\u00a0",
    "Yeah I somehow clocked in 18-24 fps (according to my phone) on epic and max res while on performance mode (5-10 fps boost) which I was surprised about. I was able to move around and stuff at night but in the day it felt closer to 10 fps.\u00a0\n\n\nI did get 40 fps on medium at night but got around high 20s-low 30s fps with around 40% resolution\u00a0",
    "Ah well. Hey at least on a positive side note Ark wasn't as laggy as I thought it was so eh",
    "Not everyone in India knows English. Not everyone in India knows Hindi. \n\n\nBesides it just gets more attention and is easier to type. It's not that easy to use other languages and that includes my own language lol",
    "Dk where you got the idea mine could do that based on my specs. I usually turn down my resolution and graphics all the way down and I still can't top 20 fps\u00a0",
    "You can definitely try though. Who knows... Maybe you might run it, you might not but defo wouldn't be smooth but ig that's a given.\u00a0",
    "Hopefully next year I'll get to use my mom's s23 ultra so I'd suggest you try the same or something similar. until then I guess it's just old ark for us now",
    "Ah bro sorry to say but from what I hear, basically all Mali GPUs won't be running the game. I've got an adreno so I thought I was off the hook but apparently you need an antutu score of 450k+ or something and my phone can't even produce half of it.\u00a0",
    "First let's see if I can even run it lol\nPoco M3",
    "Poco M3 registered but i guarantee you it won't fun more than 5 fps",
    "Poco M3, I could register but I'm losing hope I will be able",
    "Mine is like 148. How screwed on a level of screwed am I?\u00a0",
    "I have the same thing but based on my specs, I should not be able to run it",
    "Still in.",
    "Still in",
    "I think this one is sensible maybe or atleast he attempts",
    "Hawk is taller than Robby though",
    "Guess what's white and STILL IN deez nuts? \n\nStill in",
    "Its actually the exact opposite.",
    "Fine with me if I can run it but I don't think I could",
    "Current hawk is literal dog water",
    "How well would a Snapdragon 662 , 6gb ram run?",
    "I'd say 5'11-6'0",
    "Is it free? Looks like my phone which was already struggling struggling to run it will be struggling even more.. Would be cool if they could add a low graphics version too",
    "Dang it D: well ig there's still spine but then my spine might get close to being as tall as my legs",
    "Still in",
    "Still in and not taking the old guy for a spin",
    "I think 5'8 is like 172.8 or so thats why",
    "No room for legs? D:",
    "I was like 4'9 at 11, \n5'2 at 13,\n5'3 at 14, \n5'5 at 15,\n 5'6 at 16,\n5'7 at 17",
    "I live in India.",
    "I see. Thanks!",
    "Again I'm not sure that I'm 174 during the morning but there definitely is at least a 1-2 cm growth so I'd say 173-175 cm is a good range for the morning and 169-172 is a good range for the evening/night. And besides, I'm only 174/175 for like an hour or something and 171 for the rest of the day.",
    "Dk lowkey Idk if these are the right measurements anyways cuz they're done by me using my hand, the Wall and a measuring tape. \n\nLast time someone mentioned my height ( just this previous Monday ) I told them I was 168 / 5'6",
    "Hey I forgot to roll call day 1 and I did it now (day 2) for both 1 and 2. Does it count or am I out?",
    "Yolo. Still in and we ready to win",
    "Can I still get in if I forgot about this yesterday? I've been still in since like October",
    "171cm (which I am rn, right before going to bed) is 5'7. 5'8 is like 172.8/173 and so on.\u00a0",
    "I'm Indian. I use inches because people use it so much online but I use cm for a lot of other stuff. I weigh things in kg, distance in km, height maybe cm maybe feet.\u00a0",
    "Hell nah I'm 5'8 almost I'm close to the shoulders of a guy who's probably close to 6'5",
    "I've gotten rectangle, oval and heart\u00a0",
    "I don't know my exact measurements since I'm not that good at measuring but from what I've seen I measured 168,170,171,171 and in the mornings 172,173,174. But when someone mentioned my height today I said 168/5'6",
    "If my measurements are right, 171 cm is 5'7. 172 is 5'7.5/ almost 5'8. 173 is 5'8 pretty much.\u00a0",
    "Would that cost a lot?\u00a0",
    "There's barely any difference between 5'7 and 5'8",
    "I think so yeah my current height is around 172 cm and right when I wake up its 174-175",
    "Bro you're basically almost 5'9",
    "Lowkey my state's average is 5'6 and my country's average is 5'5. I'm 5'8 and I'm the 6th shortest in my class of 42. Most guys are actually close to 5'10 on average\u00a0",
    "My sister just got one. Never heard of this company before in my life either. Apparently they're a big thing in China or some.\u00a0",
    "Bro from where did you hear this from? The crack dealer behind Walmart? \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Blasphemy",
    "I dont think we should be comparing THE God to a bunch of fictional characters but yes.",
    "I don't think we should really be comparing  Jesus to fictional characters but even if we did Reality> Fiction",
    "Is there anyway to change it?",
    "Dang it",
    "You can place foundations on rafts and extend them that way. Look it up on YouTube.",
    "No the leedsichthys (the whale) isn't aggressive towards rafts on ark mobile so as long as you don't encounter something like a sarco, you can casually ride the oceans. Carried a newly tamed dire wolf all the way from winter biome to herbivore island on a raft and only got attacked by a low level sarco (Praise be to God)",
    "I wanna know as well because single player settings said I would need 17 raw meet to tame a lvl 115 Dire wolf but it took me like 32-35 which was around 1.2x taming rate",
    "2030 is crazy",
    "Don't swear to God but yes fr",
    "But yes, rape would be a better example. But pornography definitely isn't anything good. Even outside \"religion\" It basically fries your dopamine receptors.",
    "Also I just saw a short talking about how geneticists found out that all of us in fact come from the same man and woman. \"The Y chromosome comes from one man and the mitochondria DNA originated from one woman.... (Skipping some parts) that lived about 6000 years ago \" The Bible also tells us that we come from a man and a woman and if you add up the time gaps its around 6000 years.",
    "And why is it that it is in our nature to fight one another? If it was an evolutionary trait or   whatever you want to call it so we'd thrive, then why does it result in the death of people?",
    "Yes because pornography basically objectifies women to be more objects of sex and pleasure in the moment than as humans to be loved. What I mean is that God intended humanity to use sex as an act of love, not just lust. When you watch porn, you basically want their body and not yk.. Their soul or let's say, you're not looking for love. And when it comes to sex between dating couples, the thing is, God intended one man and one woman to 'become one'. Dating isn't as permanant, (especially since God has made his opinion on divorce clear) there's a higher chance you'd change partners.",
    "Yes but don't you think it's weird that people who study the science of the world who know how a lot of how our world works and still believe in God?",
    "And if I'm not mistaken, \nA lot of scientists, are believers. \nYou'd think all scientists would be atheists but actually according to a survey, 33% of scientists believe in God and a further 18% believe in some sort of higher power or being (...)",
    "Cultures and influences change moral and ethical concepts. Yes, different societies may view things differently but that doesn't mean the base line for Good and Evil wasn't ingrained in us from birth. Like we do best, humans corrupt all the things  God has set as default. \nGod made sex, Humans made Porn. \nGod made nature, metals, intelligence for the humans, resources, etc., Humans decided to fight each other with said resources for said resources. \nGod made love, Humans made Hate. \n\nFor the video game example, you can consider the fact that a lot of games have a lot of unexplorable areas too \ud83d\udc40.",
    "Hopefully",
    "Interesting.",
    "Np and apparently I just saw a tweet from the co founder of WildCard possibly hinting at Ark Mobile Revamp, check my latest post.",
    "Happy Cake Day!",
    "Link is expired",
    "Well the complexity with which I was built is pretty good evidence for me personally. Why was I made in such a way, why is there this concept of Good or Evil? Our world is made in such a way that a small change can cause massive effects, ie, it is perfectly set. Now I'm no scientist or a big guy in the science spectrum so I can't explain to you all the details regarding the scientific reasoning, for that you can look it up as you wish, but is it not true that everything requires a cause. \n\nIf our world is like a video game and we're like players or NPCs, and say something like mathematics is the code of the universe, there's gotta be a developer behind it, right?",
    "How is it flawed exactly? What do you lose from following God? You learn to be more humble, love better, and overall turn your self into a better person, and all you sacrifice is short term pleasures like porn, drugs, drinking etc. If anything it's a good trade. If he doesn't exist, you don't really lose anything and if he does, you gain a lot.",
    "does really believe that something can come out of nothing? Let me ask you this, imagine yourself as one of Jesus' disciple, let's say it was all a hoax and was planned. Alright well then which one of the options would you choose : Being Skinned alive, being crucified, being crucified upside down, being stoned, etc. They could've said \"no I was lying. Jesus is not God. \" And they may have lived but they didn't. One must wonder why. \n\nI cannot tell you 100% God exists but I'd rather take my chances. \nDid you know that the person who first proposed the big bang theory was himself a Catholic priest?",
    "If it isn't possible to 100% guarantee that God is real, but rather a probability (I'd rather take that probability than not) than how is it that you can 100% guarantee he is not real?",
    "How can you say for sure that God isn't real? Like can you guarantee it 100%? Can you really guarantee anything 100%? Also, just because Hercules coming from Greek mythology isn't real doesn't mean all \"deities\" Aren't. Only one God is real.",
    "If I decided that I didn't like some ancestor I have never seen, would that make him dissappear from existence as well? \ud83e\udd14",
    "I'm sorry to hear that but.. It is the truth. It is quite harsh to hear as a child. I wasn't really raised as 'religiously' as you, sure we had prayers when I visited my grandparents back in my home country but we rarely ever prayed. Church on Sundays only. My mom also listens to a lot of Christian music that I don't really listen to. It was more so other influences like preaching of the Gospel via social media that changed me. \n\nI may still not be the best person but with the help of Christ, I've been able to improve myself to be an overall better person. I no longer worry about exams and such because, either I can win them if I work for it and if I don't, I won't fear because the Lord has plans for me and will watch out for me. I'm sorry to hear that you may have had a bad childhood relating to Christ but please do not hate him for the actions of people! He does love you and he doesn't want for you to get hurt",
    "Hm, it's unfortunate but if you don't mind, I'd like to hear some of those things.",
    "From what you wrote, I'm guessing that you may have either read the bible for some specific reason or we're raised Christian in the more religious sense?",
    "I could tell. But have you ever considered the thought?",
    "Do you want me to repeat the same sentence twice?",
    "I got that but how do you KNOW he doesn't exist?",
    "Right because who are we to judge God based on our flawed morals",
    "How do you know as a matter of fact God isn't alive?",
    "Haven't started using retinol yet, just niacinamide and some aloe Vera gel actually.",
    "Ye but to be fair it started popping up like yesterday or the day before",

    "Are you in support of the guy or the gal?",
    "From what I got, I think what they're trying to say is at times of crisis i.e. they have nothing else to say, they can always blame it on toxic masculinity as the Problem.",
    "Nah here in India we're not allowed to bring phones into school property at all. We use the school office Telephones to call. Sometimes they get confiscated till the end of the day and sometimes you have to tell your parents to come and ask the principal to give back your phone. \n\nI can't say this is the same for all schools in all parts of India but in my school, at least. Here smuggling phones in during school is like smuggling in drugs, which from the way I hear happen more than the former.",
    "It's pretty good. I've read some points from other threads and they make sense. \n\nUniforms remove the pressure of having to wear something fashionable, you don't need to bother about what you're gonna have to wear in the morning. It also gives an equal sense. The poor and rich are essentially equal in this case. The only problems I'd see were if they were overpriced and stuff.",
    "Bo it isnt",
    "Hey bro I know it's not the situation and I'm sorry for you but, what grade are you in? My friend goes to SFS and I'm planning to go there in 11th",
    "And yes I've been participating since 1st but didn't comment",
    "Still in, I forgot to comment on the last 2 roll calls cuz I have exams so I hope from now on it counts",
    "Still in. Sorry I forgot to comment but I've been participating since Nov 1st? Do I just have to comment on those posts as well or does this count",
