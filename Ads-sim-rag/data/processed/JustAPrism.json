    "It's not that hard if you do quests in the other gamemodes too. The Remix season had a very similar time limit and I beat it in like 2-3 weeks spending only a few hours every few days on the game (cuz emoloyment. Work took up time)",

    "Canonically monsters are ingame said to be naturally weaker than humans. They were totally overwhelmed during the war and heck, in the genocide route a child with like sticks and such for weapons is able to end monsterkind alone if determined enough. So yea I don't think it would take that many gorillas even. 100 gorillas would be a blood... dustbath",
    "Yea exactly what I said.",

    "Ragebait? Anyway yea you're doing the toddlergrip which as its name goes is basically only used by tiny children who dont know how to hold pencils yet. Also that's a pen not a pencil. And a cartoonishly large pen at that",
    "Just realised there's like no straight people in hell. Like does heaven just throw all the gays down by default or",
    "Idk who most of these are but doesn't Zeno have the power to erase whole universes or multiverses or stuff including everyone from that universe even if they aren't even there at the moment in seconds just by thinking about it? Plus like he's super impulsive too and wouldn't hesitate to erase stuff on the smallest whim of literally anything",
    "My dad",
    "Left to right is oldest to youngest. So why is the youngest one puking over a toilet with a cupid over her- brb bleaching myself",
    "She tries way too hard and gets obnoxious pretty quickly. Only thing making her a fun character instead of a horrible one is she doesn't overstay her welcome and has limited screentime. Also her angelic form's balding",
    "WAAH WAAH FREE SKIN WAAAH",

    "Very different to me at least",
    "I always saw it as her only having hair at the top, having shaved the sides. So when she's in battle, she pulls her ponytail super tight to have no lose hairs get in the way and when she's casual, she lets the ponytail be a bit more relaxed and even has some free hairs to style with. That's why her pixel art sideprofile shows no hair on the sides and the ponytail coming sorta from the top of her head",
    "Comic Mark wins no diff, Show Mark wins medium diff. Deku's strong for his universe but he's nothing compared to most fictional universes",

    "Being casual and trying to haven fun instead sweating and crying at comp doesn't exactly mean someone's bad",
    "Surprisingly many characters from Jojos surprisingly would. Like not just main characters but one off gag villains too",
    "Fantasy anime always make the protagonist look either super cool to be flashy and noticable or basic as hell to not fit in. No one here looks cool so it gotta be the basic dude in the back",
    "I don't have the will to control the beast. And I'm not risking becoming a human jacket. Saiyan sucks depending on when in the series cuz people might be after me but maybe I can have a semi normal life somewhere in the universe for at least a while",
    "Probs Goku, Giorno and Eren. Goku's just broken no matter what. And the pic shows final season Eren implying he's got his powers implying other titans have to exist too. Giorno's mostly there for safety; based on pic he's peobably base giorno but gotta pick him just incase cuz if he's got Requiem then it's gameover for me before the fight even starts really",

    "Suffers from the \"bigger is better\" syndrome. All the stages look the same except it just standing up like a human. Also kinda looks more like a digimon than a pokemon",
    "Absolutely love and adore my one piece but hell, it's like a 7 or 8 at most. Post-skip's so bland. Tbh Jojo's is 10/10 for me. It's funny, it's badass, fairly well animated, has a lot of content to it while having like no filler. Also the character writing's and concepts are actually fairly deep if you look into it.",
    "Ruby kinda trash, she's from alabama",
    "Abandoner Route: You genocide until the Papyrus encounter and True Pacifist afterwards but no one trusts you anymore and the story plays out differently due to your early actions.\n\n\nCoward Route: run from battles and hide from encounters.

    "The World or Gomu Gomu no Mi. Others are majorily battle related (I live in the real world, not a shonen anime, so I have no use for combat abilities) or have a sucky drawback. Super Strength and time stop just seem handy even in normal civilian life and Gomu Gomu could let me fly around at great speeds or just screw around and have fun. + Very unlikely but maybe I'll awaken G5",
    "Birdo",
    "None of these are bad. Death Note's chill. Attack on Titan has some controversial writing choices towards the end. Jojo is a hard hitter after another hard hitter but can turn off some people cuz of its style. And Bleach is longer and more a project. So yea honestly pick out what interests you less or more and do a coin flip/dice throw",

    "Won't comment on wukong cuz idk if it's game wukong or mythology wukong\n\nOtherwise it's a tight fight between Goku's and Superman's teams.\n\nGoku's Goku and has a literal god on their team. While Superman's got Ben (can copy Goku and his strength, just needs to figure out the moveset quickly) and spongebob who depending on episode will either dry up in seconds and die before reaching the fight... or could be an immortal god of cartoon logic who can do literally anything to himself, others and the universe around himself as long as its comedic\n\nNever bring a dude with cartoon logic to a fight",
    "I'd say Algomon. Green small blobs that keep the same name regardless of stage. Also the fact they at least in some media seemingly combine together instead of evolving. + it's perfect stage has an alternate \"Worm\" mode and Ultimate form is a giant humanoid",

    "I miss c3 and c4 the most.We have OG back already and it hasn't been long enough for me to miss c5 yet\n\nI've played since c1s3 and was addicted all of c1 but the game fell off for me at c2. Returned more to the game around c3's vibe and chrome seasons. And c4 had nothing going on but was visually the coolest chapter imo and the last hope for fortnite story (too bad they dropped all their old lore)\n\nUnpopular opinion c2 kinda sucked. C2s1 was a cool reveal with the blackhole event and stuff but had nothing going on. The spy season was also mid as hell. The water season was ok but I didn't play much. And I hate Marvel so I skipped the marvel season. Primal was kinda eh but had cool mechanics like the crafting. Only s5, s7 and s8 were good that chapter imo",

    "Different kinda franchises, not comparable imo",
    "Aint they like 5 years old tho",
    "I mean ima be fair I watch basically everything dubbed cuz my eyes are a bit fucked up sometimes. + I can mess around with speeds when it comes to slowdrag shows.\n\nSubs usually sound better but almost everyone overreacts when they say dubs are bad.

    "Nearly all of Goku's abilities are learned powers and not Saiyan specific abilities. Ben would become a stronger than average saiyan but he wouldn't have any abilities, just pure brute strength and endurance. Also he needs to train to use the strength correctly and to control his Ki first",
    "can't wait to spam brainrot and earrape",
    "Nahhh I'd unsub",
    "Lego biokikkeli",

    "... what else would it be?",
    "Which one's name is it? Will the girl be Bona Petitea or the boy Bon Petite",
    "I mean frisk COULD just stand inside/between the barrier and let everyone pass one by one by holding their hand. You need 7 souls to break the barrier but only 1 human and 1 monster soul to cross it. There's not a line in undertale, deltarune or related content that says it's not possible. Soo... red is the soul of stupidity?",

    "Pink tip :/",
    "it ain't that serious but I've played since early chapter 1 so through lots of experience I've kinda grown a personal hatred for people who emote on elims. It's basically the same as getting teabagged \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",
    "Karma at it's finest, you had it coming",

    "It's right there",
    "S5. I started late s3 but only got truly into the game a few seasons later. I miss spending first half of my day at junior high during the last days before summer with the class just chilling or messing about, just to get home and mess around more in fortnite. The game didn't have sweats back then and people were almost more interested in where Kevin went and questing than actually getting W's",
    "I'm a bit trend-blind. Why do people hate her?",

Drimogemon has absolutely zero direct prevolutions or evolutions while the others already have relatives",
    "Drimogemon. The 2 others listed here already have digimon they evolve from or to that make sense as a part of line, but drimogemon is just completely alone",
    "Looks like the new fortnite battlepass skin",
