    "exactly",

    "I second this",
    "My drill is the drill that CREATES the heavens!! AAHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is peak",
    "That\u2019s Rem from peak (ReZero)",
    "Hunter Hunter if you\u2019re into normal shonen, Aot if you want a masterpiece in terms of writing. In my personal opinion, both are just as good.",
    "BASED\nand they also defend the hospital scene..",
    "Hunter Hunter or AOT imo. Hunter Hunter is a classic and Aot is a masterpiece. If you want something more modern, then Frieren.",
    "Trust me it\u2019s peak",
    "Boobs/10",
    "Idk I don\u2019t think she does",
    "You are definitely more media literate than him after what he said about Monster, but Aot still has a great ending. I understand why someone would personally not like it, but in terms of how well it\u2019s written. Aot is one of, if not the best, written anime.",
    "Truly, all the characters are great.",
    "Indeed. People hated on it but it only made an already incredibly deep series even deeper, which was pretty much impossible. Peak fiction.",
    "FRRR",
    "It\u2019s weird until it\u2019s really good until it gets REALLY weird.",

    "Hot take here, but I didn\u2019t really like it. It wasn\u2019t bad at all, but I was expecting what everyone was saying, that it changed their lives and all that. Imo the pacing felt kinda rushed. It went from \u201cI bullied you as a kid and I regret it\u201d to \u201cI wanna kill myself\u201d too fast. I feel like the first scene where the guy is about to commit su1cide is kinda pointless and they might as well just have told us that he regrets bullying the girl a lot. They just kinda throw around the idea of wanting to kill yourself around, without a care. Some characters are just badly written and useless. Tbh, if it was a series instead of a movie it might\u2019ve worked. It felt like they were just throwing in random useless content to make it slower. I genuinely feel bad that I didn\u2019t like it, felt like it should\u2019ve been a masterpiece.",
    "Came here to see this. Some people hate on the final season but imo it was just as good of a masterpiece as season two.",
    "Underrated af",
    "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re falling apart, rather they\u2019re getting bland and repetitive because that\u2019s always the ending. There are still some anime that do it well, but most are just generic love stories.",

    "What anime is this?",
    "He doesn\u2019t need friends. He was lonely, but the root of his problem was that everyone he ever met, he would trick. The only person he had in his life was mob, whom he was manipulating. That\u2019s why when he told the truth, as a result of his actions people started coming to him.",
    "Yeah, I do. I was just saying that I don\u2019t judge the people that can\u2019t stand the anime, nor would I say that they have the attention span of a fish. In fact, I would rate the anime an 8.5/10 since the pacing is the only that weighs it down and everything else is outstanding. Its just that One Piece anime has horrible pacing and thats a fact. And since that\u2019s what most people watch, then it is unnecessarily long.",
    "As a One Piece fan myself, it is. You don\u2019t need to have the attention span of a fish to not be able to handle the horrendous pacing. There may be light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel is 300 miles long.",
    "![gif](giphy|12p5byldHRgyu4)",
    "My favorite opening is pretty much all AOT openings, probably Rumbling though. Least favorite is Blue Bird from Naruto. I guess I just kinda don\u2019t like the vocals. Ashamed to admit I think Hana ni Natte from Apothecary Diaries or the Domestic Girlfriend op. The best opening ever is Sasageyo.",
    "Shinzou wo sasageyo!",
    "There\u2019s something off about his face but I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it.",

    "I just scrolled through each just saying \u201cpeak\u201d in my head.",
    "This is the best one",
    "Wtf. You can at least say \u201cI actually didn\u2019t really like it that much\u201d or something like that instead of being toxic. Didn\u2019t your parents teach you not to say eww to stuff.",
    "Imo the third season is as good, if not better than season two. Dimple arc is peak",
    "Yeah but I didn\u2019t expect so many people not to like it.",
    "Eren Yeager\n\n![gif](giphy|fAe5ZoqgP8MZG7VWON|downsized)",
    "Should I watch YuYu? Seems pretty good but idk\u2026",
    "I am not in you.",
    "No way you actually put Frieren above Solo in animation. Like Frieren animation is good, but Solo Leveling is on another level",
    "Imagine having this for the rest of your life.",
    "Gonna assume the reason you didn\u2019t include the third one is because you haven\u2019t watched it.",

    "I know Mob Psycho is kind of famous, but I still think it deserves way more attention than it gets.",
    "The Black Swordsman will never not be cool.",
    "I don\u2019t understand if this subreddit is just goofing around with the hilarious posts and claims or if these are actual braindead people. Or maybe rage-baiting. I\u2019m pretty sure its goofing around though.",

    "Listen to me: Mob Psycho is peak",
    "Honestly, the first season isn\u2019t that good except for the arc at the end (Reigen). Season 2 is where it gets REALLY good with the mogami arc, but season three has my favorite ending in all of anime and some of the best character development i\u2019ve ever seen.",

    "The best anime of all time",
