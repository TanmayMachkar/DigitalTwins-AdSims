She barely got to tell her kids she loved them and hers was completely uncalled for. Died for the pettiest reason: Simp Jealousy\n\nThen probably Koro sensei, he abandoned the warrior/assassins way of life and was just teaching kids.

He definitely lost himself in the power, but he was a man with good intentions who did the wrong thing. Still a villain, but not maniacally evil like everyone else on the list",
    "honestly I'm not justice-driven or anything,\n\nTL;DR  I don't pirate most indie games Cuz i'd feel guilty and think they deserve the money from each purchase for their effort and genuine passion. \n\nI DO pirate from corpos, but not because i don't think they deserve money or because i \"want to fight against corpo greed\" but mainly just because most corpos overprice games nowadays and I ain't paying $90 for a game just as good as $40 games a while back, except it's got better graphics.

But the best choreography and cinematography was Jinwoo vs Igris. \n\nSo much Delusion from people that haven't done a day of animating in their lives.

Infinite void wouldn't affect someone immune to poison, afflictions, curses, mental attacks\n\nMurderous intent would cut both their power in half since neither are EXTREMELY more powerful than him\n15f sukuna down to 7ish finger sukuna, easy wipe\nGojo although his infinity would be unaffected, his strength, speed, cursed energy, would all be cut in half\n\nMahoraga could be a problem, jinwoo's definitely smart enough to notice he's evolving and finish him off with Tusks sphere of avarice powered nuke, maybe add baran's lightning attack from his sword in there (since he has that now)\n\nalso\n\nIgris, Tusk and Kaisel are all S Rank shadows\nS rank battles have led to cities destroyed as collateral\nand he's got THREE\n\n\nMalevolent Shrine at half his current power would simply be ineffective\n\nJinwoo's base speed overwhelmed yoonho who's arguably the fastest S rank\n\nWith dash, he's blitzing sukuna in MS as soon as he shows up\n\n\n\n\nThank you",
