    "Sheesh and I thought the Cursed Child was a bad sequel.",
    "That explains a lot.",
    "That\u2019s a weird outfit. I confidently say this as a fashion stylist.",
    "So my cousin had the Clash of Ninja 2 game and I was watching him play and played some on his system. I got hooked on the game and loved Ino and Sasuke\u2019s fighting styles where as Naruto was really slow to move with and I just found his \u201cBelieve it\u2019s!\u201d to be annoying. So I ended up just hating Naruto because of that. So one day I was playing story mode and I was like hey this is pretty good. This is a show I should check it out. I was hooked episode one. That is such a strong episode and episode 2 is the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Naruto (the character) completely won me over in the first episode. I had bought a few of the other games before that because I love Clash of Ninja 2 so much but I started watching in summer of 2009 so I was able to binge the entire part 1. It was great. \ud83d\ude01 It\u2019s been one of my absolute favorite fandoms ever since. I love how it\u2019s so deep and yet so funny. So relatable. It was my first ever anime so I\u2019d never seen something of the sort before and honestly I\u2019ve never seen an anime quite do it justice like Naruto. I hear people say that all Shonen is the same but it\u2019s not.",
    "Amrit from Kali: Call of Darkness is very flirty but my personal preference is for Killian \u263a\ufe0f",
    "The Oblivion ending\u2026.\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d As a Lawrence fan I hated every season except for 1. 1 was amazing.",
    "Wonder how this works with the tokens\u2026",
    "I still feel like that\u2019s a Harry song \ud83d\ude02",
    "I think some of y\u2019all are missing the point. The kids Kakashi are talking about don\u2019t have to be younger than Naruto currently. They could\u2019ve been younger than Naruto in the past and still be stronger at that age like Itachi at age 11.",
    "My thoughts exactly. Great job!",
    "Naruto. I\u2019ll just give him some ramen and he\u2019ll be good. Maybe talk no Jutsu him \ud83d\ude02",
    "The only thing that\u2019s true for me with Harry is my personality \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s true to a fault.",
    "1. Naveen is a narcissist. Why do people like him? Genuinely. This is highly concerning. \n\n2. The music is bad. That\u2019s my opinion more than a fact since I hate jazz but it is my criticism. I don\u2019t like one single song. Not even remotely. \n\n3. The color palette is drab. \n\n4. The swamp is not a fun setting.\n\n5. They waste the perfectly good setting of New Orleans to replace it with the time in the swamp which feels extremely dragged out. \n\n6. None of the side characters, minus Tiana\u2019s parents and Lottie are funny or interesting. Ray Louis, Naveen, and Mama Odie are painful to watch. Painful. \n\n7. They pretty much waste the best character and relationship in the story which is Tiana and Lottie. Swap out the story in the swamp and make Lottie involved. \n\n8. Give Naveen and the side characters some bigger character growth. \n\n9. The old guy pretending to be Naveen and hitting on Lottie is creepy. \n\n10. The movie really felt like a waste of time. What substantial things happened throughout the middle of the movie?\n\n11. They wasted Tiana\u2019s relationships with her mom too. Show more of her family dynamic. Lottie and Tiana and Tiana and her parents were the best part of the movie. \n\n12. Tiana seems too perfect. Give her more flaws to overcome and grow from instead of just sloppily making her challenge be becoming human again. Give us more depth to the story. \n\n13. The story lacks any real depth after they become frogs and is replaced by cheap comedy and gross frog content. \n\n14. They spend WAYYY too much time as frogs. It\u2019s drawn out. Make it so halfway through the movie or so they turn human again and it shows that Naveen was just using Tiana only for her to be kind to him when she finds this out. He\u2019ll leave but her kindness will stick with him and then he\u2019ll try to become a kinder person. Make it believable. Show us that kindness can really impact people and change lives. Not that he\u2019s being nice because he\u2019s forced to spend time with her. Have him get what he wants first and realize it isn\u2019t what he really wants. Have him go to cooking school or something and come back years later all so he could work for her because he wants to impact her life in the way she did his. I don\u2019t know. \n\n15. Voodoo is a real thing and it\u2019s scary. That stuff is not to be messed with and that\u2019s what makes it so scary as the villain\u2019s power; it\u2019s too real. Just like Frollo as a villain or Mother Gothel\u2019s gaslighting. \n\n16. It honestly just isn\u2019t interesting after they become frogs. The characters aside from Tiana and Lottie aren\u2019t compelling, the story is bland, the jokes are bad, the setting is dull, there\u2019s too much monotony and it feels like 75% at least of the movie is wasted on useless things. What makes a good Disney movie is if it appeals to all ages. I was 13 when this movie came out but it has never once appealed to me where as the majority of animated Disney movies do.\n\n17. I can understand the criticisms about Tiana being the first black princess and spending most of the movie as a frog. It looks kind of bad.",
    "Thoughts on Anastasia?",
    "She\u2019s perfect in the 2015 version though \ud83e\udd70 that movie is perfect \ud83e\udd70",
    "And yet people love Anastasia.",
    "The Black Cauldron was great!",
    "Same. Even as an adult I find it boring. Probably even more than when I was a kid.",
    "I\u2019m shocked Hunchback was made into a children\u2019s movie.",
    "Mulan and Rapunzel???",
    "It was a cool setting until they went into the swamp \ud83d\ude11",
    "I love that movie!",
    "I\u2019m gonna get hate but Tiana.",
    "Even in adult shows I think it\u2019s gross and unnecessary",
    "I\u2019m not into women so just none of the female LIs since I only see them as friends, nor any of the demon characters. My only exception is Paulina. I love her. \u2764\ufe0f But with a male MC I didn\u2019t play as myself but as a character so it\u2019s a bit different. \n\nTheodora - I can only be with Lawrence or Friedrich. I don\u2019t like anyone else and can only stay loyal even if\u2026ya know. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAmrit - I hate that guy so much. I\u2019m curious as to why people love him but I also love Killian so I just can\u2019t see myself straying from him so in that sense any other LIs as well. \n\nKamal - He gives me the ick because he\u2019s so much older and has such a big brother role. I did choose many of the romance scenes with him for the longest time and while he\u2019s a good LI I can\u2019t get past how creepy it is. \n\nDiego - Why is he even a choice??\n\nAnyone from Wave Patrol or MHS. I just don\u2019t like those books. \n\nI\u2019m only in season 2 of CY but I really hope there are more LIs because I really just don\u2019t like any of them. \n\nSherlock - He looks terrifying and gives me SK vibes. I was stunned to learn that he was Sherlock. \n\nPSI - Anyone other than Kay. He\u2019s literally the only character I like in the entire book. I\u2019m not even sure I can actually keep reading it I dislike everyone else so much. \n\nOzar - I\u2019ve done most of his romance scenes and I just don\u2019t like him. I don\u2019t generally like cocky guys but I do like Volot and Dragan, I think Dragan was a huge jerk for most of it but he always really intrigued me as a character.",
    "Issues? I\u2019m curious as to what these issues are after hearing all this about the Amen route. I DESPISE Amrit. Boy do I love Kieran and Livius though.",
    "As I Christian I can\u2019t even play that book but I\u2019d never in a million years be with him. Never.",
    "I completely agree with your Theodora opinions",
    "I DESPISE Amrit! Killian all the way!!",
    "I love SitF but I totally agree",
    "He didn\u2019t need help grounding him back to reality. He needed love and support because of his depression. People easily write Yoosung off because of his obsession with Rika when he\u2019s clearly depressed and grieving. It\u2019s a lack of empathy or understanding for his mental health, which would be one thing if it were just with him as a character, but it happens all the time in real life. A lot of people don\u2019t care one bit or don\u2019t care enough about other\u2019s mental health or the struggles and extreme concerns that mental health can and do cause. It\u2019s not taken seriously and that\u2019s a tragedy. People lose their lives because more people don\u2019t take it seriously or just don\u2019t understand. Just because you can\u2019t see it in the same way as you can with a physical illness doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be just as, or even more dangerous. I say this and feel so strongly about it because I almost lost my life to it. I didn\u2019t have support. I relate a lot to Yoosung, and while he\u2019s a fictional character I see this as an opportunity to spread awareness for mental health and to encourage people to be more compassionate about it. Just because someone may look fine doesn\u2019t mean they are. One of the worst things you can do is nothing. Just reach out and say how you care from time to time. Loving that person and staying by their side is what they need more than anything. So Jumin didn\u2019t stand by in 707\u2019s route. He took action. And that\u2019s what more people need in their lives. But I agree. \u263a\ufe0f I feel the same exact way as you. Yoosung was my first route as well!",
    "As someone who suffered with severe depression for 4 years absolutely no. Yoosung needed help. One of the worst things you can do for a person with depression is nothing.",
    "Ugly",
    "That\u2019s not early Y2K that\u2019s 2008 at earliest.",
    "Same",
    "B. His rapping and perviness piss me off. Jiraiya\u2019s only negative trait is his pervy behavior while B is annoying in every single way. His only redeemable qualities are his fighting skills.",
    "I love him! He\u2019s hilarious! He was like the Naruto of Taka.",
    "It would\u2019ve been better had Sakura actually meant she loved Naruto when she told him and realized that he had been there all along while Sasuke hadn\u2019t. Give her some character growth.",
    "As a shy girl myself I absolutely hate how they portrayed Hinata. Girl didnt have to be a weak and spineless stalker. Couldn\u2019t they have least have shown her doing something nice for him like drawing him a picture but being too shy to give it to him yet Naruto ends up finding it anyway or just saying hi every so often or finally having enough of the bullying and standing up for him or giving him the dessert one time from her lunch? Just ONE kind interaction? That would\u2019ve given a basis for their relationship because I have absolutely no reason to ship them. None. She can be shy without being a flustered mess every time Naruto is around. If even a shy girl can\u2019t relate to her that\u2019s pretty darn sad.",
    "I like Kiba too!! It makes me so sad to see how many people hate him! I mean yeah, it\u2019s hilarious how often he uses Fang Over Fang but most people have techniques they use all the time? I mean look at Naruto and his use of [Multi] Shadow Clone Jutsu and Rasengan. Pretty much every character has 2 main jutsus that they use. That\u2019s a pathetic reason to hate him. Sure, he\u2019s not as strong as Naruto or even Shino, but he\u2019s stronger than Hinata. I think the reason why she\u2019s so loved and Kiba isn\u2019t because the majority of fans are guys and a lot of them think she\u2019s hot. Also, what\u2019s wrong with a guy who loves his dog? That\u2019s an extremely redeemable quality.",
    "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s percentage because I have way more for Volot than Minhyuk but I still have Minhyuk on my screen",
    "I get what you\u2019re saying, but at the time of this economy when it\u2019s hard for people to pay for groceries and rent it seems a bit frivolous to pay for c.ai. If it were less expensive I think many more people would pay for it.",
    "I\u2019m a straight woman but Lia from Garden of Eden is actually my favorite LI from that story by far \ud83d\ude02",
    "Am I the only one who wasn\u2019t crazy about that movie?",
    "Maleficent is a disgrace to the original Sleeping Beauty. I have no idea how anyone could like that franchise. I prefer every single movie on this list here over that.",
    "It honestly concerns me how RC has so many stories for demons and against the church.",
    "I purposely picked choices for the kindness path because I was convinced the rage path would have a bad ending but when I got to the final few chapters and realized how wrong I was I had to restart the entire story because I hated it so much.",
    "I\u2019m still convinced Naruto could do it alone",
    "How do you know this? No one is showing any sort of source for this information.",
    "Proof? Just curious because I never have heard of this.",
    "Agreed. And the amount of dislikes for you just wanting to spread the truth. Just because you\u2019re a fan of someone doesn\u2019t mean you have to blatantly spread lies about someone who\u2019s hurt them.",
    "Honestly? What did anyone see in this guy he\u2019s a creep and ugly.",
    "![gif](giphy|8MyXEVgue4ucw)",
    "But adult Aang was also realistic writing for Aang as well. That\u2019s one reason I can\u2019t stand Korra. These sequel series don\u2019t understand the core values and beliefs of the original series\u2019 titular characters which is ironic considering Mike and Bryan worked on both series in the Avatarverse.",
    "Why do you hate realistic writing for Naruto?",
    "Better yet scrap Kaguya and the Okutsuki as well as any final romances and finish it with Naruto becoming Hokage. Then make a sequel series about Sasuke readjusting to life back in the village or something.",
    "I\u2019ve literally never heard of this",
    "I hate the Jonas Brothers, always have but Jonas  LA was honestly one of the best Disney channel shows. I wish they had more seasons or shows like that with an overarching plot.",
    "She married a man who tried to kill her multiple times. Of course she\u2019s stupid.",
    "I mean Tangled, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin are the best Disney movies ever if not some of the best movies ever. The Little Mermaid is good but not in the same realm as the others. I think so many people are just saying Tangled because it\u2019s not a part of their childhood like The Little Mermaid was and nostalgia can blind us. Take nostalgia out and genuinely say which movie is the worst out of these four. Worst characters, worst character development, worst romance, worst side characters. It\u2019s not Tangled.",
    "Do you need to put the name of your character if your persona is already named that? Also! I\u2019d love to see an in depth dive into the different chat styles and what works best for different types of roleplaying/conversation. Thank you!",
    "Well guaranteed I\u2019ll never watch it now. I\u2019ll never stand for that injustice. No wonder everyone hates Boruto. Everything I learn about it sucks.",
    "The thing is it isn\u2019t funny. I\u2019ve been a part of the fandom since 2016 and I love Yoosung. I relate to him having struggled with loss and severe depression. It would be one thing if you\u2019d hear it occasionally, but as often as we do it\u2019s just not funny. People clearly do need to hear that he\u2019s depressed and grieving because if you truly believed that this joke wouldn\u2019t still be made and he would be praised for being deep like the twins.",
    "Truth of the matter is people tend to be attracted to qualities that they admire. Yoosung admires certain qualities about Rika. I could admire that my cousin is hardworking or compassionate or something and like someone with those same traits without being attracted to my cousin.",
    "I\u2019m so sick of people clearly misunderstanding Yoosung as a character. I think the people saying this just haven\u2019t been through grief frankly since he\u2019s very obviously grieving and depressed. It\u2019s not funny to joke about depression or losing a loved one. They\u2019re very serious matters and as someone who\u2019s struggled with them both I can really appreciate Yoosung as a character and feel very seen with him.",
    "That and I just don\u2019t like Elsa",
    "I never have understood why people hate Eric\u2019s flute so much but not Kristoff\u2019s lute or Stitch\u2019s guitar.",
    "Oswald. I liked him until he started talking. I understood him perfectly until then.",
    "Let me guess you\u2019ve only played Yoosung\u2019s route? I felt the same way after his route since Yoosung was my first and second route.",
    "Hinata would take five years just to finish the sentence. N-N-N-Na-N-Na\u2026\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 Temari definitely would steal the jacket. Sasuke would definitely just have killed her",
    "I love the freckles they did on Starboy! What a great design! That was what sent me down the Wish concept rabbit hole a few weeks ago.",
    "See I thought that too until I recently saw a fan animation of Star having both his cute chibi form and his Starboy form.",
    "I never understood the Starboy hype until I recently watched some fan made storyboard scenes thinking they were Disney\u2019s original ones. I like Star in the movie he\u2019s definitely my favorite and very cute but when I saw these storyboards and that Star still could\u2019ve had the cute chibi form as well I\u2019m really upset they didn\u2019t go for it. My favorites:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PFwk3aMPVFA?si=PxwerZga1OeJeMaJ\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SN1g8jXpnAs?si=q7EWqbXVHsJz4Dix\n\nThis is the movie we wanted.",
    "Yeah that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t take it. I could tell by the silhouette that the guy who attacked MC was his soccer friend.",
    "He looks like a tan Harry Styles with worse hair and for that reason I\u2019m pissed they keep trying to have us not go for him and that his personality sucks. I\u2019m really just not a fan of any of the LIs in this book but at least Anders is attractive.",
    "1C \ud83d\ude4c",
    "Worst. Song. Ever.",

    "Yes! I want one so badly! If you do it please post the link!",
