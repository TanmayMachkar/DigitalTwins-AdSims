    "Therapy will work if you seriously wants to change. I took therapy as a last resort because I was unable to change my life. I was struggling through addiction, after consulting first time ever in my life I was clean for 3 months. But after it there are ups and downs. I am taking it from last 2 months, but have skipped a lots months in the middle. \nWhat I believe is the things we are struggling don't change drastically over time. You go there in each session, tell how's it has been, what's more in situation and they will basically assist you and describe you meds if it is required each time. So, over time it becomes same.  So, I would advise that you really listen to them and get out the struggle you are facing. The sooner the better. I I have been going there for almost two years now. I have improved, but root cause is still there. \nAlso, I feel that chatgpt can better assist sometimes if you describe your situation accurately. (Just saying this as a alternative.)",

In my class, there were two women, whose ages were 47 and 54. They didn't knew each other before, but now are best friends. There is no need to be embarrassed about studying.\n\nTry to find a part-time gig in any library, so you get aware of what you are getting into. \n\nI also liked reading books and discussing them.

    "I cleared MLIS last year. I will try to answer questions.\n1. Job market is competitive for university library. As per UGC, you need at least thirteen years as a Deputy Librarian in a university library or eighteen years\u2019 experience as a College Librarian. Of course, you have to done ph.d., NET/SLET. Some extra work like: published articles in various journals, publish a book, etc. It depends on the university you are applying to. For some reputed university it will be tough and for local universities, it's all about connection and location. In some states they don't give vacancy for government job for librarian and because of that in many universities seats of BLIS students remains empty.\n\n2. Yes, tech-savy librarian's get more preference. But it's all about how you show your self in the interview. Library is service oriented job. It's all about how you cater yourself and communicate, because in India in the name of digitization they thought is about soul/koha and some consortium. It's just a skill which anyone can acquire. But yeah you sure get preferences(Because, you can do all the work of a clerk when needed) I have done CSE, getting job at any local college or school is easy.\n\n3. All libraries need someone who can digitalise their library. So, yeah I think you can dug deeper in that. I have seen some people on linkdln who assist librarian regarding koha related stuff. For research assistant I don't think you can get any gig, because everyone have their mentors. Still, you can give it a try. \n\n4. For skill development I would advise you to take online courses on : Google, Swayam, Edx etc. \n\nI personally feel getting job somewhere good is easy, if you have strong and unique portfolio. Publish articles, present them in seminars, clear NET/SLET. Make connections on LinkedIn and be in touch with all your Teachers. \n\n(I am still a newbie in this field, so if I said something wrong then sorry. All the best)",
