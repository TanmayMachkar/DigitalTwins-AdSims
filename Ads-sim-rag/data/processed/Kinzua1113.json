    "This has been covered in the webtoon, you're the one behind bud",
    "https://preview.redd.it/zfqw753krt1f1.jpeg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6549cd43254954f960d044acc8997b97f62e50df",
    "It doesnt, quite frankly",
    "Omniscient reader",
    "Bait used to be believable",
    "Well this is the anime cover and its cause shes not introduced for a bit and she doesnt really hold a mc level status like these two until far in the story, as for the webtoon, it changes periodically but its usually just kim dokja on the cover",
    "Sakura.\n\nIts an obvious pick for a reason, idc about that one cool moment sakura defenders, she is one of the worst written main characters in manga, and thats coming from a naruto fan.",
    "Balls levelling",
    "After marvels spiderman 2, im sorry but its not insomniac spiderman, legit ruined his character and world/characters around him. Id give it to spectacular but 90s is up there.",
    "Probability aftermath sparks be probability-ing",
    "Ui Goku, ready to get downvoted",
    "Basically during the demon king selection arc >!Kim Dokja impersonates as Yu Joonghyuk and Yu Joonghyuk does the same for Kim Dokja and they both become dukes of the demon realm under the others name!< so they got them wearing each others coats as a nod to that",
    "Nahh, this cover is in the demon king selection arc, cause theyre impersonating each others names so its like theyve swapped coats",
    "Because goku big strong and mc",
    "I love naruto, but its obviously sasuke. There really isnt as many characters comparable to him where you watch him truly transform, regress and completely change as a character good and bad in such a believable way, people are so critical but forget sasuke is legit 16-18 and is dealing with some of the most traumatic revelations in the series. Bro is naruto's best written character as far as I'm considered so its not really a contest when naruto is more or less a flat character that influences the world around him and goes through slight changes of thought about the world but more or less keeps his same ideals from beginning to end.",
    "Yea but you could also get the retroid pocket flip 2, same device but in ds form!",
    "Its kinda cool, i dont need to see it too often, but a perfect ui goku matching giant moro with a perfect giant ki avatar adds to that divine level hes reached",
    "Well, I mean theyre both the main characters, but if you had to choose one its like asking would you prefer omniscient reader or TWSA, and considering how TWSA has been described as a boring repititive story with going through basically every regression, i would go with kim dokja and orv",
    ">!Sun Wukong after he broke through his constriction and fused with all his selves to become the one true myth!<",
    "Its guts to be honest, subaru has suffered greatly, especially in the beginning, but now that hes taken a more proactive role and is trying not rely on his return by death, hes been cooking and things are up for him. \n\nMeanwhile guts' life has been mostly suffering since his childhood and its only gotten worse and worse, i dont think anything subaru's went through compares to the eclipse tbh",
    "Hsy",
    "Dbkai, average action enjoyer anime fan isnt gonna enjoy og dragonball, especially the beginning",
    "Everyones talking like their own personal experience reflects the game's future, the game's future is brighter than ever, it is the biggest game in the world right now popularity wise and its only getting bigger, there are issues like there are in any game but the game's not \"dying,\" not even remotely.",
    "Yoo sangah",
    "Cant decide between the secretive plotter and most ancient liberator (but tbh uriel, its just too easy an answer)",
    "Couldve been more honestly if they gave a little more of a shit about this game, all the news post release of how dead this game is has ruined what couldve been a long life for this title.",
    "Aura",
    "As a dude in this community, i can confirm I am the minority, woman go rabid over this series, specifically joongdok",
    "The anime and fanbase that came from the anime kind of ruined its rep and legacy unfortunately. Also the manga didnt exactly end as well as it could have, but in this day and age id say tg ended better than most other popular series have",
    "https://preview.redd.it/1yz23yv7wc0f1.jpeg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60aa0b71ecd2abaeaba98fe5b5c88f6b7ad59f58",
    "Forgotten",
    "Oh yes the content and story mhm, please explain to me how in the moro arc or anything prior led up to beast? Please explain to me what beast is, where it derives from besides \"muh endless potential\", please since you keep parroting the \"well gohans always had potential sooo it makes sense huhu\", you haven't made a single point besides that.",
    "You're actually slow, this is why its pointless to argue with db fans they will ignore any criticism, eat whatever slop, and call it peak. I promise you I am a more informed dragonball fan then you will ever be, doesn't change the fact that this form is bs and you could not even explain it to me without pulling headcanon out of your ass.",
    "What work? Theyve reused this plot device 3 times in the series, what work? He forgets how to use his powers every arc, that is not \"training offscreen\" that is bs writing to then have him ascend to whatever beast even is just cause piccolo was getting punched by cell max. They frame it identical to his ssj2 transformation, not even hiding its just a callback bs form thats now above ui because sure, no buildup, no working towards anything, he just farts it out when 30 minutes before in the movie he couldnt even sense piccolos ki.",
    "Haha this is what i mean, youll never actually address this bs with gohan, its just \"well actually, that only happened in the rof saga\", yeah he definetely didnt have to reawaken ultimate in the t.o.p saga even though he was 'training with piccolo' offscreen, and he DEFINETELY didnt need to reawaken his forms AGAIN with piccolo pretending to hurt pan to get him mad in superhero, no no this was all before superhero, sure dummy.",
    "That training excuse doesnt work when everytime we see gohan, hes \"gotten rusty\" \"cant sense ki\" \"I dont know if i could even turn super saiyan\" hurdur, like he cant be seriously training offscreen if he loses all his battle sense the next time we see him. And im tired of people saying gohans always been like that, no he hasnt, huge potential? Yes, but it was actually well written and had to be honed, not pulled out as a bingo card whenever we need gohan to go from not even remembering how to go ssj to ultra instinct+ level just cause he sees piccolo getting smacked by cell max, like hes never seen piccolo get beat up in a fight before or something. It is bad writing but supertards will go through the biggest loops to make it make sense before just admitting it.",
    "Gohan, he didnt earn the form or get it in a way that makes a microscopic amount of sense. \n\nAlso it looks dumb, visually his is the only one that just doesnt look right on him in the lineup.",
    "Its not a modifier, the point is his modifier was not decided on yet, hence why hes a constellation with no name",
    "Its so funny how many people in this sub literally havent read the source material, its kim dokja people cmon, they dont make it a mystery. He didnt have a modifier at this point.",
    "Outer god type beat",
    "Hes aight",
    "Yeah but filler cant be faulted for story quality when that was a studio decision to pad out the series, its not part of the main story while these new gen series being adapted are straight adaptations, no filler",
    "Yep",
    "The mangas a top 3, the anime is a miss, thought everyone figured that out by now",
    "Better written has got to go to ssj blue to be honest, but ssj3 is still a way more epic form. Blue has just had 100s of episodes of screentime from its inception, evolution and mastery (this one mostly in the manga) while ssj3 was achieved off screen and is basically useless, even though its got the most aura",
    "Yep its a bug",
    "I think its debatable, ssj blue gogeta was clearly leagues beyond broly to the point he couldnt touch gogeta once when he went blue. Couldve gone ssj2-3 or god and he probably still wouldve packed him up, just with more resistance.",
    "On one hand i agree, on the other maybe they thought having him with a tie and vest would be a little much for every panel versus the few blackbox illustrations you see between novel chapters.",
    "Sm1 i played so much of as a kid, still my fav",
    "Because broly is established and a 1 in a million mutant saiyan makes more sense than characters we already know well getting mickey mouse powerups just to match the toptiers of the verse. Piccolo from a shenron wish is ui level and gohan sees piccolo get beat up (like its the first time) and goes from blue level to beyond angel level mui, sure.",
    "Eto, arima and furuta",
    "Go gunhee, choi jung-un, cha hae-in, sung jinwoo, sung jinah",
    "Honestly, only wish for more. Im happy with how everything played out but some characters wouldve been nice to see more of like anna croft, lee sookyoung, lee seolwha, lee gilyoung (lot of lee's), and even yoo sangah in the latter half of the story.",
    "I mean itll take some time but solo levelling is literally one of the most popular anime in the world right now, of course its getting a season 3",
    "I mean, you gotta consider if your counting the anime because the anime drags a lot of things, has a shitton of filler. The naruto manga is just go go go never stopping or breaking like the anime does and it covers the best parts of the series back to back. I think naruto's manga honestly holds up pretty good, but the war arc bogs it down a lot even though i overall enjoy it, I admit that.",
    "Naruto's got peak fiction moments and arcs for sure, but as a complete package (filler not included) its pretty good, not a masterpiece but pree good",
    "10 is crazy, but it was pree good yeah like a solid 7.5-8",
    "Ima say it, yall talk and talk about just wanting more naruto, but if the series was just playing it safe yall would be bored and say it shouldve just ended with naruto. Boruto is taking what was a meh concept already at the end of naruto and giving it life in a pretty interesting scenerio/situation for the mc's for manga readers who know. Boruto's not a masterpiece or anything but its better and fresher than people give it credit for.",
    "100% true, peter just conciously (and conciously tbh) holds himself back from using his power. When doc ock took control of his body he threw a punch and smashed the dudes jaw clean off, recognizing that he couldve taken them down easily if he didnt hold back.",
    "Beat? Brother there is no competition, the power point before the end, the end before the beginning didn't even get a chance to start \ud83d\ude2d",
    "Its the kind of game i technically cannot call bad but I genuinely look at everything about it as an overall miss and just wasted potential. It was fun, but it was this close to being a memorable chapter and not a forgettable game if the story wasnt ass, if the side content, characters, and especially beginning portion of the game wasnt so weak, etc. etc., but the gameplay and web swinging is truly top notch. But again, whats good gameplay if theres nothing to do with it beside a couple of generic crime stops that are less varried than the two previous games after completing the story",
    "Death note",
    "Yeah we're cooked unfortunately",
    "Nah, i wont elaborate since your manwha only but they definetely have an interesting bond of sorts as the series progresses",
    "How is spiderman even supposed to fight him lmao",
    "Basically kaneki in dead by daylight",
    "Id argue tanjiro is only loved because of how pretty demon slayers animation is, if my hero looked as good as demon slayer from s4 onwards, i think itd carry public opinion. Beyond that, theyre both pretty cookie cutter characters, deku just cries all the time and comes off a little more lame than tanjiro tbh",
    "Lmao",
    "Cause is supposed to be ssj rage, even though they never refer to it as that in the form name or story mode. Its clear even the deva thought it was stupid.",
    "They are official yes",
    "Seven deadly frames",
    "I knew it was rich owl before even reading the name..",
    "Holy nostalgia wave, this was the spiderman beside tobey maguire I grew up with fr, iconic",
    "For the people saying dragonball z, i would genuinely recommend to try kai if you havent already. Its the version I recommend to anyone trying to get into it, all the fat cut out, a much better dub and the only people that will try to suade you away from it are people thatve grown up with Z. Im sorry but the average grown person is not trying to sit through nothing but screaming and one movement happening over an episode. Dbz is great but its padding and old dub makes it unwatchable if you havent grown up with it imo. Kai is as perfect of a recut as you can get with all the action and story given to you, no breaks, no filler.",
    "One piece, I truly cant fathom how people treat it like cinema and a must watch, the first few hundred episodes are literally baby's first anime and if youve seen better, its not going to impress/engage you whatsoever imo. I promise I wanted to like it, but it genuinely felt like I was fighting to sit through ts and not do anything else.",

    "Nicee, but wrong version of somewhere only we know \ud83d\ude29 shoulda specificed by Keane",
    "Its spiderman, cmon thats just no contest",
    "Granolah arc could work as a movie tbh, but moro's too long, lot would have to be cut",
    "You're being purposely obtuse. We have due process for a reason, otherwise anyone who people decide bad gets to be executed. By that logic if we're using marvel characters, i guess matt murdock supports pedophilia because he believes in the law and wouldnt kill one on sight.",
    "The sauce, please \ud83d\ude4f",
    "I was really into her character in the beginning up to her >!becoming a reincarnation of mandala or whatever!< after that its almost like she become a different character. Just taking a backseat and blending in to the group as one of the people that would chastice kim dokja. She just had a lot more potential imo.",
    "- Somewhere only we know\n\n- Atlantis\n\n- Skyfall\n\nTo me these 3 songs rep the series so well they could be played in the anime and it would fit perfect",
    "Where can i get these???",
    "Because people are over uncle ben's death, they've seen it a million times but creatives still want peter to experience that loss and for the viewers to feel it in new spiderman projects so aunt may has essentially become the new uncle ben."
