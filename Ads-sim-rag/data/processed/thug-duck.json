    "Depends what you mean by \u201chonor\u201d. If by that you mean \u201cdictating his own life\u201d, then definitely yes. But if it means being the killing machine he was, then nopes (although some of us are still hoping for perhaps a glimpse??) but in all seriousness, the story and character development is off the charts and most would be more satisfied if he stayed true and doesn\u2019t go back to that \u201chonor\u201d.",

    "Sorry to hear about what seems to have been painful conditioning you have gone through. It sounds like your current boyfriend is very supportive of you and from one redditor to another, what he is doing is (sadly) the norm for many guys out there, but I am sure that he would love you all the same and continue supporting you.",

    "2 key things to remember: \n\n  \nFirst, every Singaporean male has walked this path. If you look at the number of those getting FCH in many courses, yes there are always scholars and females who did not need to go NS. At the same time, there are many males who went through NS. If they can do it, so can you. It's difficult to pick back up and go at your top mental speed from Day 1. But don't worry, you will be able to rebuild and regain your intensity with discipline. \n\n  \nSecond, there is now a mental difference between you and someone who did not do NS. Those who don't do NS are always in the educational system. Maybe their mind works faster now, and they are more used to academic concepts and studying. But apart from studies, NS does add a whole other dimension to your life. Even if you hated NS and NS sucked, you can now treasure your time in uni more. Maybe NS also thought you other things which may be useful in your studies. It's not a wasted experience. \n\n  \nStay positive and determined. Many have done it. You will be able to get back stronger.",

    "Alright guys, to kickstart the discussion - is anyone looking to purchase the XM5s? \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve had the wf-1000xm3s for about 3 years now and the left earbud dies after 30 minutes. I\u2019ve read a lot about the battery drain issues for wf-1000xm4s and am a little concerned about the upcoming XM5s.\n\nAlthough I haven\u2019t tried the xm4s personally, I do think that AirPods Pro Gen 2\u2019s ANC and spatial audio is pretty fantastic. \n\nStill, I think I might just give the XM5s a shot. There\u2019s always that thrill when you get your hands on the latest shiny new toy. \n\nThoughts?",

    "Hey fellow duck!! I\u2019m new to fut and have been reading all your guides! You are amazing and your guides really helped me. I\u2019m up to about 200k with a decent PL 80-82 team!! \n\nI wanna ask: do you think Lucas potm\u2019s price will rise? Following the logic of TOTW players prices (you used Antonio Valencia as an example of how prices are inflated, fall, then rise), if potm cards aren\u2019t packed, supply will be low and the price will rise over the year.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure if demand would fall? Players will want higher rated wingers as the game progresses, and release of more high rated gold card wingers (say willian or salah) may bring the demand for Lucas potm down.\n\nDo you know whether the prices of potm from past years rose or fell?

    "Yes Jinbei will most definitely listen to Luffy. What eats at me is that Jinbei's wisdom and knowledge might take away some of the goofy and happy-go-lucky antics of the crew. For example we might not see say Usopp and Chopper fighting over whether they should head in a particular direction because Jinbei has knowledge of sea currents and would point the ship in the right direction. My point is that he is rather sensible compared to the rest of the crew. It would be interesting if Oda decides to add some quirks to Jinbei.",
