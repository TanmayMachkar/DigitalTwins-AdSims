    "Not sure exactly what kind of help you\u2019re looking for.. I try to match what areas are shaded with the original image. In this image\u2019s case though just consider there\u2019d be less bright/reflective areas on the breasts with skin than with shiny latex/leather material of her outfit, so more of the underside of the breasts should be a dark shade like her neck/armpit area.. probably using the colours of the shoulder/armpit area would be a good fit for your light/dark/mid.\n\nAs for the nipples\u2026 I usually just take the colours of the light/dark skin tones and add some red then darken/play with saturation until I find something I like.. not sure if what art app you\u2019re using has colour/brightness/saturation sliders though\u2026 \n\nConstructive criticism here: I wouldn\u2019t have the crotch area be brighter than the rest of the lower body like you\u2019ve done... Also try to keep a similar level of detail as with the rest of the image or it looks jarring.. I really doubt her vaginal area would look like a single simple line like that.. try and at least differentiate the labia majora/minora with some more shading to make it somewhat more anatomical.. and yeahh.. breasts aren\u2019t orbs.. aim more for raindrops lol.. that\u2019s my amateur artist take.",

    "Its not a basic/vanilla show to be appreciated by everyone, hence why i think its a bad rec. Its not an easy watch, and benefitted from releasing when edginess was popular. Its exploring of very heavy/disturbing themes might not be a good introduction to \"new to anime\" viewers. I myself having been watching anime 20 years gave it a shot earlier this year and couldn't get through it. I doubt an anime noob will have a great time either and would be at risk of being turned off the artform. Its a show you'd definitely need to be in the mood for.. not for going in blind.\n\nPros - some good action\n\nCons- too edgy, useless/boring MC, mentally unwell characters in a messed up situation used as the show's main gimmick.\n\nSome of the cons can be pros if used well/in good context.. it would have been helped if the characters were aged up but nope, they're high school age and that's pretty messed up in itself.

Not that evaluating shows based on enjoyment is dumb...\n\nNot one sentence of what he said was \"evaluating shows based on enjoyment is dumb\" You wrongly pieced together different bits of what he was trying to say into that.

    "OMG FINALLY\n\nHE. LITERALLY. DIDN'T.\n\nYOU said that. You inserted yourself after falsely interpretating his words and turned it into your entire argument.\n\nAll he did was assume the OP didn't have good reason to give all the shows 8/10 or better and made an ill informed comment on that.

But what you don't realize is that was completely irrelevant to his actual opinion on the show or his right to express it here. Something which YOU attacked him for FIRST. That makes you equally into someone making dumb comments here, namely all of them.

None of what any of you say matters against his opinion or his right to express it here in an open forum. OMG he said his rating of it here in the place where people come to RATE ANIME!?!?! NO WAY!?!?!. The only objective thing here is you in proving how ridiculously low your maturity level is is.\n\nHe just didn't like it! big deal! Go touch grass, seriously.",
    "Can't defeat my argument so descending to personal insults? lol. Maybe some time for self-reflection is needed.\n\nWhat exactly were you right about? I'm not seeing it. Sure, I'll admit he made a dumb comment on the OPs rating system. But at no point did any of you explain why he couldn't give it a 3/10. You can't be right and someone else can't be wrong when it's literally a matter of personal opinion.\n\nAll I saw from you was childish lashing out.. really liked the \"Okay, dude.\u00a0You're the coolest and most elite of us all\" bit.. really drives the nail in from my perspective.\n\nI'll say it again. Nobody owes you anything. Grow up.",
    "You, child, called him out for ragebaiting for simply giving it a 3/10 which may perfectly sum up his personal opinion. You could have been an adult, taken his different opinion at face value and left it at that. But you couldn't overcome your own bias, took personal offense at him disliking something you like, and demanded an explanation and refuted all arguments since then. \n\nYou're not the authority on what's good and what isn't. Nobody owes you anything. Get over yourself.",
    "no, I don't spend my time on it unless the opportunity presents. I'm mainly here defending the other guy u/MajorLgiver after you biased children all swarmed on him for disliking it. People don't have to like the things you like or explain themselves when they don't. Grow up, go touch grass.",

One Piece definitely has the most \u201call ages/all audiences\u201d feel to it of the 3.

Eventually we could see growths forming on both sides of his face around his mouth so went to the vet and X-rays had shown tumours around his lower jaw and the bone there was essentially deteriorated away. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much they could do at that stage\u2026 could only prescribe medicine to keep him as comfortable as possible as he slowly got sicker and lost a lot of his weight from not being able to eat very well. Tried a liquid diet but that didn\u2019t last for long.. Had to have him put down as a mercy rather than watching him suffer and waste away. \n\nMy advice is it won\u2019t hurt to at least get it checked out.

Back then the humour and the fun, camaraderie-like elements of the series is what made me a fan.. Now years later the quality of the writing and worldbuilding is what kept me a fan. A pandemic rewatch a few years ago was a great experience too and made me appreciate the show that much more with a changed perspective in my old age lol\u2026 maybe at the start you might struggle, but once you get through east blue it definitely is no longer just a kids show that\u2019s for sure.",

Anime was nearly caught up so they\u2019re doing a little break and releasing a remake/re-edit of an arc from 2011-2012 that some fans felt had pacing issues.. that should go until April to give manga time to pull ahead. In the 1100+ episodes now one piece also has fewer filler episodes than any of the other major shonen anime that One Piece is commonly grouped with.. to the degree of 10% for OP vs  >40% in the other series.\n\nDon\u2019t let that 1100+ number seem daunting to you, it\u2019s really not that difficult to watch that much of something once you really get into it.. even easier when it\u2019s something of One Pieces\u2019 quality.

    "Raw power number doesn\u2019t necessarily make a good party, it\u2019s mostly just to show off\u2026 best way to increase that power:\n1. limit break weapons that give full party stat boosts - focusing on either patk or matk based on party composition.\n2. focus on a specific element for each character and pair with a matching summon, materia, and element % equipment\n3. Non elemental damage increasing stats like raw patk/matk, physical/magical ability potency, ability potency\n4. Hp\n\nSource: me. 1.9 mil+ power \n\nWhen actually clearing content my parties will usually have half that or less depending on how much defensive stats or support abilities are needed. If you haven\u2019t pulled on LB weapons you likely won\u2019t see that power score ramp up much unfortunately. \n\nAnyways, the above can apply to increasing your effectiveness in content but you want to balance things out by how effective each tier up is for your R. abilities.. if a tier up of elemental potency gives 30% more damage, great, do it. If it\u2019s only 10 or 15% potency increase for tier 6 to 7 then maybe do physical/magical potency up instead. Just gotta find the best combinations overall from your gear.",

    "They aren't going to give you top of the line wifi equipment by default/for free.

But, with that tradeoff in some cases the signal ends up too weak/unstable to be fast/reliable anyways...  Think of it like AM radio > FM radio -  Older modems with older antennas could reach further, and were good for slow/moderate speeds. But they were less secure, more prone to interference, and slower on the top end, which is why they get phased out.\n\nSo what's the solution? Invest in your own router/wifi equipment and solve your own problem.. I did so when I was with Access and have continued to do so with SaskTel... their modems are all shit compared to 3rd party options out there... get equipment that blows them all out of the water and make your internet experience vastly better.

    "I watched them in the order of Bleach > Naruto > one piece and how I would rank them is 1. One Piece, 2. Bleach, 3. Naruto.\n\nHeres my essay:\n\nOne piece is my personal favourite anime, and it also has the best world building and character development of the big 3. Oda will slip in little details early on that end up being a major piece of the puzzle hundreds of chapters/eps down the line and the connecting of the dots is a phenomenal experience. It also has the least filler and a lot of it is worth watching anyways, especially the G-8 arc. It\u2019s also the funniest and has the most emotional depth to it imo. As a 30+ man I\u2019ve cried from one piece multiple times and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it.\n\nI prefer Bleach over Naruto and the current thousand year blood war saga is pretty peak. Bleach is probably the most mature (at least now it is, maybe not always as one piece has some very dark moments) and Naruto is the least mature of the 3 if that helps. As an adult it might be hardest to get into Naruto as it\u2019s aimed for the youngest audience. Naruto feels pretty linear and doesn\u2019t really divert from a few major plot elements, some of the arcs feel insanely long and drawn out (I know saying that as a one piece fan feels weird but with Naruto it feels worse lol)\u2026 and yeah I don\u2019t know if Bleach ever had a main story \u201cgoal\u201d to be honest.. just disconnected story arcs partially connected by a villain later on.\n\nAll of the art is unique but bleach probably is the most detailed, and Naruto does have some truly great animated fight scenes.. one piece as the oldest had that 90s charm to the art early on which I always liked, and they improved it but maintained its style up until the time skip where it lost some of that charm.. but post-timeskip has its own great visuals too.\n\nIn rewatchability: \none piece - endlessly\nbleach - pretty easily\nNaruto - got bored\n\nAnd yeah, one piece is 1100+ episodes now.. but having watched most of them at least twice it\u2019s not hard at all to get through. You have plenty of time to watch them slowly since it\u2019s got a couple more years at least until it\u2019s done.. but once you start you\u2019ll probably end up binging it like most of us do and get through them all in no time anyways lol. Bleach took a 10 year break and just came back stronger in this current arc, pretty great stuff.. and Naruto is done. Fuck boruto, absolute trash.",

And it's part of the job, so get the hate back, and keep going, simple as that, cause it's... their... job...\n\na DPS's main job is to kill a pull as quickly and \"efficiently\" as possible, the way they do that varies by the size of the pull.. if they're doing area damage on big pulls they'll pull less hate on individual enemies but more overall, so then it's more for the tank to have to maintain across multiple targets.. Then single target damage should be used on small pulls or after most enemies in a large pull are dead, and that will pull more hate, and all of this should be a given. Should DPS also be using enmity reduction techniques? of course! - if they have them, but not all DPS have them, and they shouldn't under-perform to baby a tank that's not doing their job - unless it will LITERALLY KILL EVERYONE if they don't tone it down... which likely won't be the case.\n\nHealers... now healers... if you're of the mind that DPS taking damage will slow down a healer's ability to do damage themselves, I'll disagree.. The enemy's damage is being dealt regardless, it's just where it's being dealt that changes.. and that's what aoe heals are for since guess what? They created heals that hit multiple people! Imagine that! Apart from that.. not every healer likes to do damage themselves, and healing DPS just gives them more to do, which isn't really a bad thing...\n\nNow as I have this viewpoint, I'll tell you that I've played every job in the game to 60 and have a lot of experience in each role.. Am I perfect? No. Do my points have validity? Yes, and experience tells me that.. Disagree with me all you want but I do know what I'm doing. Usually I do take my mentor status a little more seriously than I did with this tank in this Qarn dungeon which we've gone horribly off topic from..  But it was just an obtuse p.o.s. who I didn't want to give the time of day to.. but hey, like I said I'm not perfect.\n\nWow... that \"simple nutshell\" ended up being pretty long.. meh.",
    "Once again, disagree. The tanks may make the pulls but the DPS decide the pacing.. A pull could be small and over in a couple minutes with trash DPS, or a huge pull that lasts a few seconds with great dps.. it's entirely up to how effective the damage gets dealt in the party. The only pacing adjustments tanks do is in accordance with how effective their DPS are.\n\nNow tanking, or holding hate and how easy/hard that is, is affected by how good the DPS are, and tanks need to work harder to hold hate with good DPS. If i'm tanking and losing hate, then I'm happy, because that means my DPS are badass and i'm gonna work harder to hold hate, because once again, it's within a tank's means to do so and I know as a tank my damage is lower than the DPS' so I'll do my main job.. which is holding hate.\n\nYou talk about DPS stealing hate as if it's something that shouldn't be allowed/should be frowned upon.. All it really means is they're doing their job, and doing it better than the tank. And granted, for when these things happen DPS are given some degree of damage avoidance/mitigation themselves, and usually things work out fine. As long as I'm not dead I'll go balls out all I want and blame the tank for not doing their job, because my job is to kill things quickly-an enemy that's dead is an enemy that isn't hurting anyone, whether that's me if i have hate or the tank if they have hate. There is literally no excuse for one player to do less/play worse to accommodate another player who isn't performing, that's just silly.",
    "Get over yourself it was freaking Qarn... To not steal hate i'd have literally had to stand there, attack half as much as I did and not use cooldowns period.. I didn't have time to wait for the tank to get good. The healer didn't do dps but that was fine, it kept everyone alive the whole dungeon, and kept me, a squishy dps alive as i tanked the last boss after the tank rage quit... Notice the other party member (yellow line) telling the tank to learn how to keep aggro... If that's not enough evidence that I wasn't the only one feeling the way I did in the party idk what else to tell you.\n\nI'm sick of this \"the tank is always right\" mentality that exists on practically all these forums... this is my first and last post in r/ffxiv.. \n\nedit- In addition to that... I completely disagree with you. If a dps steals hate that tank isn't doing their job... since it's not hard for GOOD tanks to maintain hate even when dps are going all out... Since ultimately pacing depends on DPS; the most effective damage dealers in the group... you know-DPS-\"Damage\" Per Second... whose effectiveness results in how fast things die... which makes healers have to heal less (more time for them to.. you guessed it, DPS!!!)... and do way more damage than tanks so Q.Q all you want but you better use flash more than 3 bloody times if you can't hold hate.... If this isn't obvious to you YOU need to go back to basics friend.\n\nP.S. I have this point of view as someone who spends equal time DPSing and tanking and I DO understand the roles... And you bet your arse I hold hate when I tank.",
    "believe me if the person (who was not a new tank btw) wasn't being rude themselves I would have put in an effort, but this tank didn't deserve it... The tank hoped the dps would die after stealing hate and made no effort to take hate back/complained about using enmity techniques.. that's not the kind of tank I want to say \"hi, friend! let me tell you where you can improve and hold your hand through the process\"... that's the kind of tank i say \"git gud\" and laugh at when they flip out.. hence this post",
    "Semi new to Reddit here and realizing for people to understand me I guess I needed to provide way more backstory.. the tank wasn't new, already had 60 war main and was claiming to be very good at their job.. this tank lacked knowledge of the basics and failed to do their job all run long, and complained at the dps for stealing hate/was hoping for us to die and making no effort to get hate back. That kind of attitude doesn't instill much enthusiasm in me to help or teach that person, that kind of attitude ruins games like this and deserves ridicule, hence why I posted this as something for people to be amused by.",

    "A little backstory: Tank was getting a little frustrated at me stealing hate with aoes all dungeon. It didn't know what mobs to fight, getting itself killed to bees and other stuff numerous times throughout. Not to mention trapping the healer and other dps in 2 croc aoes and almost letting them die.. So i tanked crocs at the end which apparently was a big no no to the tank.",
