    "February. I'm fuckd",
    "Cuz I dont care for the sentra ? And it was kind of a natural \u00e9volution to 1st renting the new 2021 elantra back then, to then realizing how much I love the car and it's only big lackluster feature being \u00e0 d\u00e9cent motor, which naturally leads me to sticking to the elantra but moving up in model and power. I just kept loving the orange on the side everytime I saw it and got \"tired\" of the blue. Soon as I decided I'd eventually buy a N, the color plan was also sinked in.",
    "Thanks !!",
    "It's gonna end up in Nissan's Monarch orange and black like the 2021/2022 sentra",
    "Unreal tournament  3. It got burned into my old plasma tv xD",
    "F4 not a single h\u00e9sitation",
    "Blade no questions asked.\n\nI highly recommend Agents of S.h.i.e.l.d\n\nNew mutants wasnt a bad watch and had some interesting stuff, but his ultimately of no consequence in the grand scheme of things",
    "Yeah no, Chao gpt hurts the environnement more than that 17mpg does. I found my answer anyways, 6.1L/ 100km which is only slightly worst that what I do on my 2021 non-N elantra. Pretty impressive",
    "Understandable, but it's because we dont get many good things as gamers in the last few years. When something sp\u00e9cial comes out, ppl get thrilled. That's what this is",
    "But it's still missable if platinum hunting is your thing . Him restating that is correct",
    "It's everything BUT overrated. And I still haven't found a single person that said it's bad, overrated, not worth it etc. That just didn't completely suck with the battle system\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udee0",
    "Parry is optimal but if its too hard, dodge is just as good. There is one very specific side boss fight after act 2 that requires dodging for 2 out of the 3 enemies in front of you, Parry won't work (at least not from my 10/15 tries at it, switching to full dodge won me the fight in try # 2)",
    "The honest \"cons\". \n1) Parry can be difficult and some fights will require a few restarts (that is a plus for me personnally\ud83d\ude09)\n\n2)You might often find some invisible walls where you felt you could go explore. I found them to be helpful to keep \u00e0 sense of direction without \u00e0 minimap, but others could complain about this and nobody could say it's wrong.\n\n 3) Lack of minimap. Again depends on who you are as a gamer. For me it was a 100% pro since it favorised immersion and wonder, but it's something not for everyone.\n\n4) fights might become a bit repetitive if you feel the need to grind. However, the variety of enemies is still large and boring fights can be beaten in seconds with proper builds (instadeath cannon being one of the most amazingly fun thing you find towards the later part of the game xD it's not named that, but you will understand)\n\n5) while the music is god tier, it's sometimes looping on repetitively. This annoyed me exactly twice in 64 hours.\n\n6) some people have complained about the UI for pictos and lumen. I'd say this is the game weakest aspect indeed. Thankfully, it's not confusing and you can ignore it pretty quickly if you just gear up/ weapon change/ adjust while in camping.",
    "They could try but shouldnt be allowed too. I'm curious to know for sure too",
    "Is there any chance anyone can do the MPG conversion to the Canadian equivalent ? (L/100km)",
    "Can work but the concept needs more conceptualization",
    "Bro.",
    "$123457890... US\n\n1234568890$... CAN",
    "I guess the true question is : is it meant for your pleasure viewing or theirs ?",
    "Well, you got me there altho arguably, the production scope isn't the same but hey, you still not wrong price isnt everything.",
    "I joined one the same day online by Lucky thanns tho",
    "Emotions too and moment like goto not being scared, beru not explaining his \"power up\" as a size r\u00e9duction to favor speed, not showing sung throwing the criminal in the boss room as fodder since he was \u00e0 rapist, for example",
    "I said Killua but he's \u00e0 better fit for assassin and minato for speedster",
    "Killua for fkn sure",
    "Who gonna pretend that 24 hours with Yoruichi isn't \u00e0 fkn full on training session\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06",
    "Denying that Deadpool delivered a solid fucking cushion for them to fall back on, no matter your thought on the film, seems like \u00e0 big omission",
    "Exxxxxaaaaactly the same as me. Tried 3 times. I tried I really didnt. It's not without merits and that's why I stock around like almost 20 hours the 3rd times but I wasnt having fun...",
    "It might feel better at 10$ than full price because it isn't \u00e0 good game for it's full price \ud83d\ude05",
    "Putting down Kingpin but not Daredevil and Punisher is kinda crazy.",
    "Just sent a request too"
