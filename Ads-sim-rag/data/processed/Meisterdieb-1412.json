    "Misplitter is his BiS Weapon as PMC and Reruns soon on Cronical Wish Banner.\n\nMaybe you should go get it. It's a great weapon for most DPS anyways",
    "30 Yun Yuns to have a sleepover with",
    "Citlali. Aether was never this relaxed and goofy with anyone else",
    "To this day I don't get why they retold the movies and did them worse\ud83d\udc80.\n\nThe paycing is slower and quality is lower. \n\nI enjoyed the other Arcs though, even though the Goku Black Arc had a bad ending and the anime does my favourite transformation SSJ God not very often",
    "A new Circlet with Crit Dmg Main Stat with way more Crit Rate or Atk and a Goblet with Cryo DMG Bonus with as much as Crit Rate as possible.\n\n Against a freezed enemy and atleast 2 cryo Team Mates you get 55% additional Crit Rate, which is why you only need Max 45% Crit Rate",
    "If you run her with Furina you could craft a Atk% Goblet with Crit Sub Stats",
    "I love SSJ God. The red hair anf flame aura is so sick. I really liked the idea of God Ki too",
    "They could be insanely strong if they would learn to use God Ki. Vegeta was able to get it with a year of training too. So 5 years for Tien and Crillin seems doable. I don't think Yamcha would do great though. Hope my boy gets some respect though and learns it in 5 years",
    "F",
    "Oops looked up the weapon. Don't know the english names of them lmao.",
    "Her ATK Stat is really good but all these Crit rolls could be Anomaly Rolls (which is all she needs together with Atk)\n\nTry to aim for 420 AP",
    "He can do insane numbers. The difference is that the best 4* Supports are way better than the best 4* DPS in doing the job done. I would say building Xiangling is more vailuble than gaming, because it's off field damage and easy builded",
    "The Rising of the Shield Hero. Season 2 was ok too, but not far as good as the first season",
    "He is one of the best 4* in the game. I would deeply recommend to build him better (with focussing his talents and Level first before Artifacts)",
    "Obviously he does low damage on Level 70 with a propably mid build. He is only a sub DPS and Battery for Furina",
    "Didn't think to use Hydro MC with her lmao. Gotta try this. Hyped for Cryo MC to go wild with Escoffier and Furina",
    "She is the best pair with Furina and you have Xinqui (hydro sword guy) too. Any Hydro or Cryo DPS could go insane with them",
    "OG Dragonball: Bulma, Dragonball Z: Videl, Dragonball Super: Kefla",
    "Design only it's Fused Zamasu. i love the drib and the Angel like design. Personality and fights it's Gogeta all the way",
    "Yeah doing that already, but they all suck or are Crit Rate\ud83d\udc80",
    "Thanks! I want to switch to a Crit Dmg Main Stat at the Drive 4. I also get 50% Crit DMG already with her weapon",
    "Imagine Kaioken Tien using Kikoho vs Imperfect Cell",
    "He was able to absorb it to go UI so absorbing it to Blast it is 100% possible",
    "Favourite Design is god and favourite Lore is SSJ 4",
    "For her full buff she needs 420 AP",
    "I thought that a Character that utilizes the Side effect of every 15 Seconds damage would be fun to play. His kit would make explosion doing like 10 times the damage would be fun to play",
    "What about the Freemogems though",
    "No idea take my upvote \ud83d\ude06",
    "Yelans f2p bow because of Skirk Support makes a lot of sense! good point",
    "yeah but it still weird to get a bow for a healer like Diona which has already many alternatives.",
    "Seth gives her the rest AP",
    "Where are my Blizzard Strayer Mains?! I farmed that Dungeon sooo much for Ayaka and the Set should work on Skirk too until I got a good new Set for her",
    "I have read, that it's worth it if you manage to get 420 AP on her",
    "Sadly her 4. Drive is bad",
    "84 Crit Rate is wayyyy too much on Blizzard Set. Aim for max 45% Crit Rate against freezable Enemys and about 65% Crit Rate against non freezable Enemys\n\nNevermind I just saw that you are on 2 piece sorry \ud83d\udc80. 84% is then near perfect",
    "That is the best thing someone could have told me. I love trying different builds!",
    "Why not Shenhe Burst too?\nWould the Boss be dead to quickly by Escoffier and Furina lmao?",
    "In the summer event last year we got got some Wanderer and Nilou Content. It was a new limited area were we saved a corrupted Dragon in a story Quest, because he was similiar to Wanders Fate. Then the Dragon got Reborn similiar to Wanderer too",
    "I will propably play it for the next weeks, but will grind it threw the weekend. I don't want to rush this so called work of Art",
    "Done that\ud83d\ude4f",
    "Citlali would work too if you got her. If not Yelan",
    "Basically she Shreds Hydro and Cryo resistence by 55% if only Cryo and Hydro Characters are in the team. She has sub DPS with her Skill similiar to Furina and has team wide heal in her burst for Furina Fanfare",
    "Citlali could be used to if no Shenhe",
    "Not a fan of SSJ Blue, because it is more used than my favourite form SSJ God, but it makes a lot of sense to use the God Ki in a super Saiyan way. Using SSJ3 is the same mistake as using muscle form SSJ Grade 3.",
    "Whoever wished for becoming the strongest in the universe. Dumb Ass Plot. I would have thought of it as logical if the super Dragonballs would have been used. But weak ass 2 tiny Dragonballs???",
    "She can be duo Geo and Duo PECH Elements (Pyro, Electro, Cryo and Hydro). Yelan and Furina are popular in a Xilonen C0 Team for Noelle",
    "I don't think so. I think her bar would fill up if C2, because Geo Stamples are active there",
    "Ice Chef does literally nothing for Noelles damage except heiling for Furina Buff",
    "Each could just snap with their fingers and they would be gone. Only one that could survive because of Gag Manga is Saitama",
    "I would preffer Vegito if Fusion would have stayed permanent with only Dragonballs being able to end it or other plot devices. I am so tilted fusion ends anytime before he can finish off a threat",
    "Basically my reaction to Beast Gohan",
    "Ty for the numbers. I was wondering why I was ,, only \" Top 6%",
    "For some reason only Top 6%. Doesn't it count the crit Rate from freeze?",
    "It's just a way to show it's even more ridiciolus to pull. The math is behind the <<<<5%",
    "Got one today too! Was so surprised, because I didn't know it was out yet lmao",
    "Yooo that's an insane flex. Btw the german \u00fc in the Nicknames lmao",
    "Honestly the show died a couple of seasons ago for me personally. I regularly watch the first seasons with Friends and am happy with that. If it would get cancelled I would watch the last episode to see if they cooked something up there and glory the sponge legacy similiar to Ash from Pokemon",
    "I got Mewtwo 2 years ago during a Go Rocket Quest. After beating Giovanni you could catch Mewtwo",
    "Holyyyy...I got like 3 best buddys, because they are my favourites",
    "I really like the Style of Gokus Hair! Love the spikyness to the front",
    "A solid on set Circlet is actually insanely good. I would say better than any other great artifact to get",
    "When Teen Goku had his rematch against Tien and put down his weights. Krillin and Yamcha struggling to even move with some of them and Goku straight up doing a tornado for warm up. I was like: LET HIM COOK BRO WHAT\" (I was like 8 or so)",
    "Yes you do her Ult twice every rotation and every rotation is really short",
    "Her casually yeeting Childe into an abysal hole",
    "Well I do for Quicken Keqing. Seeing her Spam ult seems so fun",
    "Zamasu will body him at the beginning and Broly will adapt and kill him",
    "Wrong she gets more energy for Electro Units and Cooldown goes down faster",
    "This is now canon for me",
    "Neuvillete Kazuha Xilonen and Furina \n\nKazuha and Bennete if Pyro needs to be swirled\n\nC2 Kazuha for Quicken Teams (if Xilonen is C2 too though she is maybe better)",
    "First C1 and depending on the team you wanna use him C2 and then his weapon\n\nLike if you wanna do big reactions C2 is worth more than His weapon (speaking of someone who has him C1R1. His weapon honestly isn't that big of a deal)",
    "Like I said I came back to the game. I was just surprised it nearly doubled. Inflation even kicks in the Pokemon Go Shop \ud83d\udc80",
    "Miyabi switched with Jane Doe is my Team. Vivian does more dmg there, because Jane doesn't have a good build yet",
    "If Dragonball was Peak",
    "Damn that's actually insane. That's like 300k in Overworld/Abyss. The Crown is a lot of Cope with the Substats \ud83d\udc80. Atleast a lot Atk%.\n\nIn Abyss a Crit Rate Crown would be better for consistent  crits though",
    "True. I also forgot about the MH Set Yanfei can use together with Furina (her best set in my opinion)",
    "Yanfei, Citlali, Benette, Xinqcui or how 4* hydro sword called\n\nThis is propably her best team in general with Citlali could being swapped by Furina",
    "If this is a ,,good\" piece I wanna see your average or bad pieces \ud83d\udc80",
    "Put it on a Geo Support with a Favonious Weapon \n\nThey need to crit to make the weapon generate Particles for your Noelle. The high Crit Rolls won't be wasted this way",
    "If you use her with Furina Def% is better than Geo%. If not Def% is fine, but without Furina Geo% would be better",
    "Vivian by far. You can use her for later Anomaly DPS Characters too. The Signature propably only effictive for Zane Doe and the A Rank Character",
    "I think this Build is better thanks to the Atk and no Crit Rate Substats",
    "Is she in first build on a Atk% on 5. Slot and the second build on Physical DMG%?\n\nI wonder how the first build has so much more Atk",
    "I actually used Nicole with them, because she was already builded and it was really fun",
    "Update:\n\nI got SUPER lucky and got Zane Doe and her weapon.\nI will Play her with Vivian and like another sub recommended use Seth or Lucy with them",
    "Update:\n\nI got SUPER lucky and got Zane Doe and her weapon.\nI will Play her with Vivian and like another sub recommended use Seth or Lucy with them",
    "Update:\n\nI got SUPER lucky and got Zane Doe and her weapon.\nI will Play her with Vivian and like another sub recommended use Seth or Lucy with them",
    "Cancer isn't technically a wound that can get healed so I don't think Dende can heal cancer like a senzu bean can't heal the Heart Virus",
    "I think Instant Transmission wouldn't work in our world, because Human Power Levels would be to low to lock on to. I would take flying over Instant Transmission",
    "M6 Seth and M2 Lucy\n\nI guess I will try Seth, because I need Lucy for my Evelyn",
    "I heard that Atk is insane in ZZZ. Can you explain how?",
    "\ud83d\udde3\ufe0fJAAANE",
    "I have Pipers W Engine once, but will propably get it more often when pulling for Vivians Weapon",
    "Could I use soneone different as Lucy? I need her as a support for my Evelyn",
    "Vivian had to Aurafarm for Lord Phaethon",
    "Sitting on the Wipe Out Goes so hard. Vivian had to farm Aura for Lord Phaethon",
    "Great for Support Characters so yeah keep it",
    "M6 first day is wild\nCongrats!",
    "I had a Support build for her. Just changed it as a placeholder",
    "Honestly SSJ3 goes harder than usual. Glad for the golden hair in SSJ 1 and 2 though",
    "I wouldn't hate her, but the end of her story Arc was poorly written. Her playstyle is really fun though",
    "How high should AP be?",
    "Same. You can play her as a plunge DPS at C0 just as good as C6 though",
    "Zhongli is one of the best Shielders because of his 20% Resistence Shred. You can use others though",
    "So weit ich wei\u00df nur von Programmen gefunden und noch nicht von Menschen",
    "Unusable. Give it to me",
    "If you have Nahida it's worth building him. He is usually in a Quicken Team with Raiden or Fischl and a shielder like Zhongli",
    "The 4 Piece Wanderers Troupe if you get another feather",
    "I think Mika could be fun to use with skirk",
    "As much as I heard yes. And without Problems when on Atk% Goblet",
    "Skirk Furina Mika Shenhe/Citlali",
    "Gokus Design and Vegetas Personality",
    "Mika could be fun to use making Skirks NAs faster",
    "Misplitter if she is 100% Sword. Maybe the Battlepass Weapon if I need more CR",
    "Ohhhh I thought her kit basically Swirls Elements like in Genshin without buffing but dealing more dmg depending on the element. Thank You!",
    "Like I said overcaping on crit here. It's not a bad build, but could be a lot better with lower Crit Rate",
    "Your Crit Rate is to high. Her Core Skill gives her 25% so you should aim for around 70%",
    "I just realised you are also german like me lmao",
    "Glad it worked lmao. Great work!",
    "0 but she is guranteed after loosing to Mona",
    "I hoped to play her in a Reverse Melt Team without Escoffier, but it seems I need to run her Freeze with Furina, Shenhe/Citlali and Mika for some heal and Speed until Escoffier Reruns",
    "Xilonen is great for Noelle. If not C2 she needs 2 PECH Elements on the team though",
    ",,I wanna get her back but killing her would be kinda too much....Guess that should do\"",
    "Gens Cola",
    "If I like the playstyle I pull. I loved Kinich Design and he was kinda cool in the story, but was so disapointed in his playstyle being a mini game I didn't enjoy that I didn't pull.\n\nI pulled Mavuika though because she is the Archon even though her playstyle is ok to me. Really don't like the modern things in Natlan, but doing the Donuts  is kinda fun Not gonna lie",
    "I think an EM Sands would do more dmg with Bennete and the Weapon already giving much Atk",
    ",,C6 Furina C5 Yelan C6 Kazuha on lower investment \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\"",
    "Neuvillete, Kazuha, Xilonen and Furina is such a goated Team",
    "I was thinking about Electro MC for super conduct and energy for Iansan",
    "Need to farm the domain for another 2 pieces (farming it since release was super unlucky so far)",
    "CONGRATS",
    "Faruzan is great for every Anemo DPS eccept Chasca",
    "Escoffier seems to be cracked and Skirk will propably release soon too",
    "I lost to Mona and have no pulls :( . Hope to still get her early (if not I get Skirk)",
    "I just lost my 50/50 to Mona instead of getting C2. You should go for it, if you don't have plans for a Character coming soon",
    "Soon Xilonen Reruns. You can go Noelle, Furina, Yelan and Xilonen C0 (if Xilonen is C2 you could use Geo instead of Yelan like Gorou)",
    "1. Pokemon to find: Hoenn\n2. Aestetics: Alola\n3. Story and Art Style: Unova\n4. Mechanic: X/Y Mega Evolution",
    "What would be the Team and rotation though to make 0 energy possible?",
    "Damage Bonus and Energy for Noelle",
    "Until the Goku Black Arc Vegetas Character was so bland. i respected him again when he beat up Black with his Speech about having Gokus Body, but not understanding it",
    "I love Phantom Knights, but they are viable already after the Link Support",
    "Remember the piece of paper he got from Squidward? He was most skilled with that",
    "Remember the sheet of Paper he got from Squidward? He was most skilled with that",
    "Sadly didn't even got Chiori C0",
    "Kit Spoiler: Escoffier works perfectly with Furina, but best in a team with only Hydro/Cryo",
    "Still Hydro support, if I don't have energy problems on Furina?",
    "Even without Furina she will be usable. Maybe without Furina her damage would be some % better with a Cryo Goblet, but nothing too insane",
    "Isn't Atk% better anyways if used with Furina, which she will be?",
    "Mine was Keqing a week ago. Good that we both are happy about it \u2728",
    "Wait people hate him? I'm new on the Dr Stone Subreddit. Why though? I love him",
    "I love James Character with every Cell of my body. Jessie and Meowth were sometimes annoying but I loved it when they were goofy together all the time.",
    "Naaah ain't no Wife \ud83d\udc80",
    "Darksouls/Eldenring",
    "Until you get Furina, Iansan,Ororon or Bennete are propably best in Slot",
    "The Colours remind me of No Game No Life Artstyle",
    "Omg that is so perfect",
    "I hope you use him with Bennete for the EM Sands to not lose much atk. What are your other units?",
    "Shenhe Q E, Mavuika E on Cinders City Set, Bennete Q, Aloy Q",
    "I have Xilonen C1 and planned to pull for her C2 for this exact reason (and also her other huge buffs for other teams)",
    "She is far from the worst. Defenetly no Meta, but playable with some Investment",
    "A Character which personality becomes being in love with the Traveller like many fans were disapointed with Citlali, Mitsuki and basically most female Characters",
    "CONGRATS",
    "My First 5* was Qiqi in Beginners Banner. Used her together with Barbara for perma freeze against enemys",
    "Well I do have C6 Mika lmao",
    "Bro are you whaling or just incredible unlucky?",
    "Lmao a friend of mine has C7 Mona too \ud83d\udc80",
    "With Quickbloom she is actually good. Nothing near Meta, but fun to Play",
    "Lmao most of them were standard banner or when you could pick a 5*\n\nLost to her twice",
    "She was misunderstood by us though, because we talked to her in fear. All of the House of the Heart stayed on their own in the end and the ones with deleted memorys live a happy life and don't have to remember the rough training and killing. \n\nShe simply didn't show her true self to the wanderer and Childe, because there was no use for her too. She was propably scaring them intentionaly to protect her children or something.\n\nShe was also never really a villain which can be seen in the animated short where was shown why she wanted to be the cold and respected father and not like her mother acting all loving while not caring.\n\nAll in one she is a cold father that actually deeply cares for her children and now a little for the Traveller too, because of the help we gave to her in the story, which is why she didn't kill us and just showed her true power to us",
    "Why though? I think her Character is really well written",
    "I want her to be similiar to Arlecchino. Badass Cold blooded on the outside, but deep caring in the inside",
    "Well Kazuha Shreds 40% with VV with no restrictions of the Team and with his passive He gives Damage% the more EM he has.\nHis Sub DPS is good too.\nThe only thing Ice Coffee is a lot better at is the Team Healing",
    "I forgot to mention that she can heal the team, which is great for Furina Freeze Teams though\n\nI thought about running: Ayaka/Skirk, Furina, Escoffier and Shenhe",
    "Thank you.\nI also thought that she could be good for him. Sadly she is missing off field electro Aplication.",
    "The C6 makes him a solid on field DPS that can be played in Plunge teams or with Yelan/Xingqiu",
    "We get 40% crit Rate from the Artifact Set Already\n\nMore Crit Rate wouldn't be nessecary really",
    "I would say 4pc WT and YaoYao on 4p Deepwood",
    "What are the other team Mates Cons? 96k seems way to much for C0 Team with These Artifacts",
    "Should atleast have 2 rolls of your picked stats though. Can't be too bad",
    "I think the 4. Stat was Def or Atk. I already got a on Set Atk% Goblet with good stats, but hoped for an improvement",
    "This is exactly my team with Xianyun instead of Jean. it's so fun and is actually good",
    "I loved to explore Natlan with the Characters Kits and Dinosours. I just think the Natlan Characters don't feel much like Genshin Characters anymore flying on Motorcycles and Weapons",
    "She gets it once she comes Home. I prefarmed 60 books now for her",
    "Which set you mean exactly on Fischl? The one from Fontaine or the Electro Dmg one from Mondstadt?",

    "Honestly the Japanese Dub is good and Paimon not as screechy loud as her english VA. Only Downside to Japanese Dub is, that I need to read all the time and can't space out while questing",
    "Even without Spiral Abyss Buff she deals over 50k with every Plunge",
    "If you have Xianyun, that could be a good on Set goblet",
    "I also think Atk, but a lot of DPS scale of Hp, so why not?",
    "For Day 1 these may be even above average superiour normal luck",
    "I think Atk too. the HP is copium",
    "About 3 Months ago. Pushed threw the content with the free S Rank Character in order to get as many pulls for Miyabi as possible and even got her M2 E1 (I actually won all the 50/50s unlike in Genshin lmao)",
    "And take any other Crit Dmg Goblet than the one you have right now. With Cr, EM or Atk/Atk%. If needed some ER",
    "100% switch from ER Sands to EM or Atk%",
    "I liked the fact that they achieved it more easily, because of their fathers being super saiyans, but there should have been more weight on them achieving it and not just: ,,Lmao I wanna be super saiyan too\"",
