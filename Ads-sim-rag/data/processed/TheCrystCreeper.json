    "I don't think heavy needs a 4th slot personally. You trade reliable close range damage for overwhelming healing from a dps class. Other items that give nonhealing classes healing are almost always overpowered, like the half-zatoichi or conch which when used as intended don't really have any major downside and outweigh losing a shotgun at worse to being a direct upgrade at best. Shotgun heavy gives you much faster access to dps even if only at short ranges. I would even argue at close distance the shotgun is always better than the minigun if unreved. The major downside to the shotgun is its range, where the minigun becomes much better. The only downside to the sandwiches is the eating animation, which isn't an issue when you have a medic, and it becomes an instant mid health pack and where the second ot takes to rev isn't as dire because you have an extra 150 hp alread and if you need the expediety of the shotgun to save your med from a bombing enemy you should have chosen the shotgun or have had better positioning and or awareness. Not to mention the second bannana being op for medicines team comps.\nAnyways, Thanks for listening to my Tedtalk \n\nTL;DR the sandwich is already overpowered enough.",
