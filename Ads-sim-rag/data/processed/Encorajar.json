    "I\u2018m not 35, but running over to your friends house just to look if they come out to play is an experience they won\u2019t have at all. Shitty smartphones ruined so much.",
    "You know there are mysterious things called \u201ecomma\u201c",
    "I'm excited! Thank you, dude and have a nice day!",
    "Everything is possible, but the higher the enemys rank, the higher the chance that it won\u2019t work",
    "One Piece Opening 1 and 4, BUT: German version\n\nTrust me\u2026eventhough you might understand nothing, they go really hard",
    "I love so many N64 games like OoT, Smash64, Banjo&Kazooie or Wave Race, but I\u2019m gonna go and say:\n\nSuper Mario 64\u2026what a game, what a dream of a game",
    "Josh McDermitt (Eugene) from TWD. After reading the comments, I must say other actors fit better, but he was the first one I thought about",
    "I got it as a birthday present in maybe 2005 and I guess the first game was either Mario Sunshine or Double Dash.",

    "I understand but that but still it\u2019s kinda \u201esad\u201c to look at for me. I grew up watching videos of David Belle and Damian Walters and now it\u2019s just these I spin myself around in an area of 2 squaremeters kinda things. I think you know what I mean and that I don\u2019t want to hate anyone for what they\u2019re doing with it now",
    "I just don\u2019t understand why. I mean nice movement and all but it doesn\u2019t really have to do with the term \u201eParkour\u201c imo.\nBtw the sideflip was nice, wanted to mention that before",
    "I might get hate for that, but hear me out\u2026no offense against this guy particularly, BUT:\nIMO these lines have nothing to do with Parkour at all. The flips are mostly the part what comes even close to parkour. I learned that Parkour is the fastest way from point A to point B, Freerunning is almost the same, but includes flips and tricks, and Tricking is just like it says only tricks.\nReally, I don\u2019t wanna spread hate or something, but these videos of people jumping some stairs up and down while twisting around a bit, doing one flip and calling it Parkour, are driving me crazy.",

    "Lol shining wizard is an easy one to dodge imo. It\u2019s pretty obvious and you have more time to cancel it than on other throws. And you don\u2019t have to guess if it is a 1 or 2 break like with Giant Swing or the Tijuana Twister.\n\nOver all you can often smash the 1 or 2 buttons and get to escape.",

Keine andere Sprache der Welt, zumindest die, die ich bis jetzt so kennengelernt habe, macht das.\n\nZweiter Punkt: der Genus in der deutschen Sprache ist v\u00f6llig irrelevant. Oder warum sind fast alle Obstsorten feminin (die Birne, die Kirsche, die Orange) und nur \u201cder\u201d Apfel ist maskulin?\n\nIn der ukrainischen Sprache richtet sich der Artikel zum Beispiel nach dem Geschlecht des Wortes. Dabei sagt das Geschlecht des Wortes aber auch nichts \u00fcber das Objekt oder die Person aus (z.B. im Ukrainischen: \u201cdie Arsch\u201d und \u201cder Toilette\u201d)",
